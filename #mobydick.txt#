Loomings


Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely-
having li        le or no money in my purse, and no    hing par    icular     o
in    eres     me on shore, I     hough     I would sail abou     a li        le and see
    he wa    ery par     of     he world. I     is a way I have of driving off     he
spleen and regula    ing     he circula    ion. Whenever I find myself growing
grim abou         he mou    h; whenever i     is a damp, drizzly November in my
soul; whenever I find myself involun    arily pausing before coffin
warehouses, and bringing up     he rear of every funeral I mee    ; and
especially whenever my hypos ge     such an upper hand of me,     ha     i    
requires a s    rong moral principle     o preven     me from delibera    ely
s    epping in    o     he s    ree    , and me    hodically knocking people's ha    s
off-     hen, I accoun     i     high     ime     o ge         o sea as soon as I
can. This is my subs    i    u    e for pis    ol and ball. Wi    h a philosophical
flourish Ca    o     hrows himself upon his sword; I quie    ly     ake     o     he

almos     all men in     heir degree, some     ime or o    her, cherish very
nearly     he same feelings     owards     he ocean wi    h me.

There now is your insular ci    y of     he Manha        oes, bel    ed round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds i     wi    h
her surf. Righ     and lef    ,     he s    ree    s     ake you wa    erward. I    s ex    reme
down    own is     he ba        ery, where     ha     noble mole is washed by waves,
and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were ou     of sigh    
of land.  Look a         he crowds of wa    er-gazers     here.

Circumambula    e     he ci    y of a dreamy Sabba    h af    ernoon. Go from
Corlears Hook     o Coen    ies Slip, and from     hence, by Whi    ehall,
nor    hward. Wha     do you see?- Pos    ed like silen     sen    inels all around
    he     own, s    and     housands upon     housands of mor    al men fixed in ocean
reveries. Some leaning agains         he spiles; some sea    ed upon     he
pier-heads; some looking over     he bulwarks of ships from China; some
high alof     in     he rigging, as if s    riving     o ge     a s    ill be        er
seaward peep. Bu         hese are all landsmen; of week days pen     up in
la    h and plas    er-     ied     o coun    ers, nailed     o benches, clinched     o
desks. How     hen is     his? Are     he green fields gone? Wha     do     hey
here?

Bu     look! here come more crowds, pacing s    raigh     for     he wa    er, and
seemingly bound for a dive. S    range! No    hing will con    en         hem bu    
    he ex    remes     limi     of     he land; loi    ering under     he shady lee of
yonder warehouses will no     suffice. No. They mus     ge     jus     as nigh
    he wa    er as     hey possibly can wi    hou     falling And     here     hey s    and-
miles of     hem- leagues. Inlanders all,     hey come from lanes and
alleys, s    ree    s avenues- nor    h, eas    , sou    h, and wes    . Ye     here     hey

compasses of all     hose ships a        rac         hem     hi    her?

Once more. Say you are in     he coun    ry; in some high land of
lakes. Take almos     any pa    h you please, and     en     o one i     carries you
down in a dale, and leaves you     here by a pool in     he s    ream. There
is magic in i    . Le         he mos     absen    -minded of men be plunged in his
deepes     reveries- s    and     ha     man on his legs, se     his fee     a-going,
and he will infallibly lead you     o wa    er, if wa    er     here be in all
    ha     region. Should you ever be a    hirs     in     he grea     American deser    ,
    ry     his experimen    , if your caravan happen     o be supplied wi    h a
me    aphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, medi    a    ion and wa    er
are wedded for ever.

Bu     here is an ar    is    . He desires     o pain     you     he dreamies    ,
shadies    , quie    es    , mos     enchan    ing bi     of roman    ic landscape in all
    he valley of     he Saco. Wha     is     he chief elemen     he employs? There
s    and his     rees, each wi    h a hollow     runk, as if a hermi     and a
crucifix were wi    hin; and here sleeps his meadow, and     here sleep his
ca        le; and up from yonder co        age goes a sleepy smoke. Deep in    o
dis    an     woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching     o overlapping spurs of
moun    ains ba    hed in     heir hill-side blue. Bu         hough     he pic    ure lies
    hus     ranced, and     hough     his pine-    ree shakes down i    s sighs like
leaves upon     his shepherd's head, ye     all were vain, unless     he
shepherd's eye were fixed upon     he magic s    ream before him. Go visi    
    he Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
knee-deep among Tiger-lilies- wha     is     he one charm wan    ing?- Wa    er-
    here is no     a drop of wa    er     here! Were Niagara bu     a ca    arac     of
sand, would you     ravel your     housand miles     o see i    ? Why did     he
poor poe     of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving     wo handfuls of
silver, delibera    e whe    her     o buy him a coa    , which he sadly needed,
or inves     his money in a pedes    rian     rip     o Rockaway Beach? Why is
almos     every robus     heal    hy boy wi    h a robus     heal    hy soul in him, a    
some     ime or o    her crazy     o go     o sea? Why upon your firs     voyage as
a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mys    ical vibra    ion, when
firs         old     ha     you and your ship were now ou     of sigh     of land? Why
did     he old Persians hold     he sea holy? Why did     he Greeks give i     a
separa    e dei    y, and own bro    her of Jove? Surely all     his is no    
wi    hou     meaning. And s    ill deeper     he meaning of     ha     s    ory of
Narcissus, who because he could no     grasp     he     ormen    ing, mild image
he saw in     he foun    ain, plunged in    o i     and was drowned. Bu         ha    
same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.  I     is     he
image of     he ungraspable phan    om of life; and     his is     he key     o i    
all.

Now, when I say     ha     I am in     he habi     of going     o sea whenever I
begin     o grow hazy abou         he eyes, and begin     o be over conscious of
my lungs, I do no     mean     o have i     inferred     ha     I ever go     o sea as
a passenger. For     o go as a passenger you mus     needs have a purse,
and a purse is bu     a rag unless you have some    hing in i    . Besides,
passengers ge     sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don'     sleep of nigh    s- do
no     enjoy     hemselves much, as a general     hing;- no, I never go as a
passenger; nor,     hough I am some    hing of a sal    , do I ever go     o sea
as a Commodore, or a Cap    ain, or a Cook. I abandon     he glory and
dis    inc    ion of such offices     o     hose who like     hem. For my par    , I
abomina    e all honorable respec    able     oils,     rials, and     ribula    ions
of every kind wha    soever. I     is qui    e as much as I can do     o     ake
care of myself, wi    hou         aking care of ships, barques, brigs,
schooners, and wha     no    . And as for going as cook,-     hough I confess
    here is considerable glory in     ha    , a cook being a sor     of officer
on ship-board- ye    , somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;-     hough
once broiled, judiciously bu        ered, and judgma    ically sal    ed and
peppered,     here is no one who will speak more respec    fully, no         o
say reveren    ially, of a broiled fowl     han I will. I     is ou     of     he
idola    rous do    ings of     he old Egyp    ians upon broiled ibis and roas    ed
river horse,     ha     you see     he mummies of     hose crea    ures in     heir
huge bakehouses     he pyramids.

No, when I go     o sea, I go as a simple sailor, righ     before     he mas    ,
plumb down in    o     he fore-cas    le, alof         here     o     he royal
mas    -head. True,     hey ra    her order me abou     some, and make me jump
from spar     o spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And a     firs    ,
    his sor     of     hing is unpleasan     enough. I         ouches one's sense of
honor, par    icularly if you come of an old es    ablished family in     he
land,     he Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanu    es. And more
    han all, if jus     previous     o pu        ing your hand in    o     he     ar-po    , you
have been lording i     as a coun    ry schoolmas    er, making     he     alles    
boys s    and in awe of you. The     ransi    ion is a keen one, I assure you,
from a schoolmas    er     o a sailor, and requires a s    rong decoc    ion of
Seneca and     he S    oics     o enable you     o grin and bear i    . Bu     even
    his wears off in     ime.

Wha     of i    , if some old hunks of a sea-cap    ain orders me     o ge     a
broom and sweep down     he decks? Wha     does     ha     indigni    y amoun         o,
weighed, I mean, in     he scales of     he New Tes    amen    ? Do you     hink     he
archangel Gabriel     hinks any    hing     he less of me, because I promp    ly
and respec    fully obey     ha     old hunks in     ha     par    icular ins    ance? Who
ain'     a slave? Tell me     ha    . Well,     hen, however     he old sea-cap    ains
may order me abou    - however     hey may     hump and punch me abou    , I have
    he sa    isfac    ion of knowing     ha     i     is all righ    ;     ha     everybody else
is one way or o    her served in much     he same way- ei    her in a physical
or me    aphysical poin     of view,     ha     is; and so     he universal     hump is
passed round, and all hands should rub each o    her's shoulder-blades,
and be con    en    .

Again, I always go     o sea as a sailor, because     hey make a poin     of
paying me for my     rouble, whereas     hey never pay passengers a single
penny     ha     I ever heard of. On     he con    rary, passengers     hemselves
mus     pay. And     here is all     he difference in     he world be    ween paying
and being paid. The ac     of paying is perhaps     he mos     uncomfor    able
inflic    ion     ha         he     wo orchard     hieves en    ailed upon us. Bu     being
paid,- wha     will compare wi    h i    ? The urbane ac    ivi    y wi    h which a
man receives money is really marvellous, considering     ha     we so
earnes    ly believe money     o be     he roo     of all ear    hly ills, and     ha    
on no accoun     can a monied man en    er heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we
consign ourselves     o perdi    ion!

Finally, I always go     o sea as a sailor, because of     he wholesome
exercise and pure air of     he fore-cas    le deck. For as in     his world,
head winds are far more prevalen         han winds from as    ern (    ha     is, if
you never viola    e     he Py    hagorean maxim), so for     he mos     par         he
Commodore on     he quar    er-deck ge    s his a    mosphere a     second hand from
    he sailors on     he forecas    le. He     hinks he brea    hes i     firs    ; bu    
no     so. In much     he same way do     he commonal    y lead     heir leaders in
many o    her     hings, a         he same     ime     ha         he leaders li        le suspec    
i    . Bu     wherefore i     was     ha     af    er having repea    edly smel         he sea
as a merchan     sailor, I should now     ake i     in    o my head     o go on a
whaling voyage;     his     he invisible police officer of     he Fa    es, who
has     he cons    an     surveillance of me, and secre    ly dogs me, and
influences me in some unaccoun    able way- he can be        er answer     han
any one else. And, doub    less, my going on     his whaling voyage, formed
par     of     he grand programme of Providence     ha     was drawn up a long
    ime ago. I     came in as a sor     of brief in    erlude and solo be    ween
more ex    ensive performances. I     ake i         ha         his par     of     he bill
mus     have run some    hing like     his:

                      "Grand Con    es    ed Elec    ion
              for     he Presidency of     he Uni    ed S    a    es."

                  "Whaling voyage by one Ishmael."

                  "Bloody ba        le in Affghanis    an."

Though I canno         ell why i     was exac    ly     ha         hose s    age managers,     he Fa    es, pu     me
down for     his shabby par     of a whaling voyage, when o    hers were se     down for magnificen    
par    s in high     ragedies, and shor     and easy par    s in gen    eel comedies, and jolly par    s in
farces-     hough I canno         ell why     his was exac    ly; ye    , now     ha     I recall all     he
circums    ances, I     hink I can see a li        le in    o     he springs and mo    ives which being
cunningly presen    ed     o me under various disguises, induced me     o se     abou     performing     he
par     I did, besides cajoling me in    o     he delusion     ha     i     was a choice resul    ing from my
own unbiased freewill and discrimina    ing judgmen    .

Chief among     hese mo    ives was     he overwhelming idea of     he grea    
whale himself. Such a por    en    ous and mys    erious mons    er roused all my
curiosi    y. Then     he wild and dis    an     seas where he rolled his island
bulk;     he undeliverable, nameless perils of     he whale;     hese, wi    h
all     he a        ending marvels of a     housand Pa    agonian sigh    s and sounds,
helped     o sway me     o my wish. Wi    h o    her men, perhaps, such     hings
would no     have been inducemen    s; bu     as for me, I am     ormen    ed wi    h
an everlas    ing i    ch for     hings remo    e. I love     o sail forbidden seas,
and land on barbarous coas    s. No     ignoring wha     is good, I am quick
    o perceive a horror, and could s    ill be social wi    h i    - would     hey
le     me- since i     is bu     well     o be on friendly     erms wi    h all     he
inma    es of     he place one lodges in.

By reason of     hese     hings,     hen,     he whaling voyage was welcome;     he
grea     flood-ga    es of     he wonder-world swung open, and in     he wild
concei    s     ha     swayed me     o my purpose,     wo and     wo     here floa    ed in    o
my inmos     soul, endless processions of     he whale, and, mid mos     of
    hem all, one grand hooded phan    om, like a snow hill in     he air.




The Carpe    -Bag


I s    uffed a shir     or     wo in    o my old carpe    -bag,     ucked i     under my
arm, and s    ar    ed for Cape Horn and     he Pacific. Qui        ing     he good
ci    y of old Manha        o, I duly arrived in New Bedford. I     was a
Sa    urday nigh     in December. Much was I disappoin    ed upon learning
    ha         he li        le packe     for Nan    ucke     had already sailed, and     ha     no
way of reaching     ha     place would offer,     ill     he following Monday.

As mos     young candida    es for     he pains and penal    ies of whaling s    op
a         his same New Bedford,     hence     o embark on     heir voyage, i     may as
well be rela    ed     ha     I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind
was made up     o sail in no o    her     han a Nan    ucke     craf    , because     here
was a fine, bois    erous some    hing abou     every    hing connec    ed wi    h     ha    
famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides     hough New
Bedford has of la    e been gradually monopolizing     he business of
whaling, and     hough in     his ma        er poor old Nan    ucke     is now much
behind her, ye     Nan    ucke     was her grea     original-     he Tyre of     his
Car    hage;-     he place where     he firs     dead American whale was
s    randed. Where else bu     from Nan    ucke     did     hose aboriginal
whalemen,     he Red-Men, firs     sally ou     in canoes     o give chase     o     he
Levia    han? And where bu     from Nan    ucke    ,     oo, did     ha     firs    
adven    urous li        le sloop pu     for    h, par    ly laden wi    h impor    ed
cobbles    ones- so goes     he s    ory-     o     hrow a         he whales, in order     o
discover when     hey were nigh enough     o risk a harpoon from     he
bowspri    ?

Now having a nigh    , a day, and s    ill ano    her nigh     following before
me in New Bedford, ere could embark for my des    ined por    , i     became a
ma        er of concernmen     where I was     o ea     and sleep meanwhile. I     was
a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal nigh    , bi    ingly
cold and cheerless. I knew no one in     he place. Wi    h anxious grapnels
I had sounded my pocke    , and only brough     up a few pieces of silver,-
So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I     o myself, as I s    ood in     he
middle of a dreary s    ree     shouldering my bag, and comparing     he
    owards     he nor    h wi    h     he darkness     owards     he sou    h- wherever in
your wisdom you may conclude     o lodge for     he nigh    , my dear Ishmael,
be sure     o inquire     he price, and don'     be     oo par    icular.

Wi    h hal    ing s    eps I paced     he s    ree    s, and passed     he sign of "The
Crossed Harpoons"- bu     i     looked     oo expensive and jolly
    here. Fur    her on, from     he brigh     red windows of     he "Sword-Fish
Inn,"     here came such ferven     rays,     ha     i     seemed     o have mel    ed     he
packed snow and ice from before     he house, for everywhere else     he
congealed fros     lay     en inches     hick in a hard, asphal    ic pavemen    ,-

    hough     I, pausing one momen         o wa    ch     he broad glare in     he s    ree    ,
and hear     he sounds of     he     inkling glasses wi    hin. Bu     go on,

Such dreary s    ree    s! blocks of blackness, no     houses, on ei    her hand,
and here and     here a candle, like a candle moving abou     in a     omb. A

    he     own proved all bu     deser    ed. Bu     presen    ly I came     o a smoky
ligh     proceeding from a low, wide building,     he door of which s    ood
invi    ingly open. I     had a careless look, as if i     were mean     for     he
uses of     he public; so, en    ering,     he firs         hing I did was     o

flying par    icles almos     choked me, are     hese ashes from     ha    
des    royed ci    y, Gomorrah? Bu     "The Crossed Harpoons," and     he "The
Sword-Fish?"-     his,     hen mus     needs be     he sign of "The Trap."
However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice wi    hin, pushed
on and opened a second, in    erior door.

I     seemed     he grea     Black Parliamen     si        ing in Tophe    . A hundred
black faces     urned round in     heir rows     o peer; and beyond, a black
Angel of Doom was bea    ing a book in a pulpi    . I     was a negro church;
and     he preacher's     ex     was abou         he blackness of darkness, and     he
weeping and wailing and     ee    h-gnashing     here. Ha, Ishmael, mu        ered
I, backing ou    , Wre    ched en    er    ainmen     a         he sign of 'The Trap!'

Moving on, I a     las     came     o a dim sor     of ligh     no     far from     he
docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in     he air; and looking up, saw a
swinging sign over     he door wi    h a whi    e pain    ing upon i    , fain    ly
represen    ing     all s    raigh     je     of mis    y spray, and     hese words
undernea    h- "The Spou    er Inn:- Pe    er Coffin."

Coffin?- Spou    er?- Ra    her ominous in     ha     par    icular connexion,
    hough     I. Bu     i     is a common name in Nan    ucke    ,     hey say, and I
suppose     his Pe    er here is an emigran     from     here. As     he ligh    
looked so dim, and     he place, for     he     ime, looked quie     enough, and
    he dilapida    ed li        le wooden house i    self looked as if i     migh     have
been car    ed here from     he ruins of some burn     dis    ric    , and as     he
swinging sign had a pover    y-s    ricken sor     of creak     o i    , I     hough    
    ha     here was     he very spo     for cheap lodgings, and     he bes     of pea
coffee.

I     was a queer sor     of place- a gable-ended old house, one side
palsied as i     were, and leaning over sadly. I     s    ood on a sharp bleak
corner, where     ha         empes    uous wind Euroclydon kep     up a worse
howling     han ever i     did abou     poor Paul's     ossed craf    .  Euroclydon,
never    heless, is a migh    y pleasan     zephyr     o any one in-doors, wi    h
his fee     on     he hob quie    ly     oas    ing for bed. "In of     ha         empes    uous
wind called Euroclydon," says an old wri    er- of whose works I possess
    he only copy ex    an    - "i     make    h a marvellous difference, whe    her
    hou lookes     ou     a     i     from a glass window where     he fros     is all on

where     he fros     is on bo    h sides, and of which     he wigh     Dea    h is     he
only glazier." True enough,     hough     I, as     his passage occurred     o my
mind- old black-le        er,     hou reasones     well. Yes,     hese eyes are
windows, and     his body of mine is     he house. Wha     a pi    y     hey didn'

now. The universe is finished;     he copes    one is on, and     he chips
were car    ed off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus     here, cha        ering
his     ee    h agains         he curbs    one for his pillow, and shaking off his

and pu     a corn-cob in    o his mou    h, and ye         ha     would no     keep ou    
    he     empes    uous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red
silken wrapper- (he had a redder one af    erwards) pooh, pooh! Wha     a

give me     he privilege of making my own summer wi    h my own coals.

Bu     wha         hinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding     hem
up     o     he grand nor    hern ligh    s? Would no     Lazarus ra    her be in
Suma    ra     han here? Would he no     far ra    her lay him down leng    hwise

i    self, in order     o keep ou         his fros    ?

Now,     ha     Lazarus should lie s    randed     here on     he curbs    one before
    he door of Dives,     his is more wonderful     han     ha     an iceberg should
be moored     o one of     he Moluccas. Ye     Dives himself, he     oo lives
like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a
presiden     of a     emperance socie    y, he only drinks     he     epid     ears of

Bu     no more of     his blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and     here

The Spou    er-Inn


En    ering     ha     gable-ended Spou    er-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, s    raggling en    ry wi    h old-fashioned wainsco    s, reminding one of
    he bulwarks of some condemned old craf    . On one side hung a very

    ha     in     he unequal crossligh    s by which you viewed i    , i     was only

careful inquiry of     he neighbors,     ha     you could any way arrive a     an

    hrowing open     he li        le window     owards     he back of     he en    ry, you a    
las     come     o     he conclusion     ha     such an idea, however wild, migh    
no     be al    oge    her unwarran    ed.

Bu     wha     mos     puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,

wha         ha     marvellous pain    ing mean    . Ever and anon a brigh    , bu    ,
alas, decep    ive idea would dar     you     hrough.- I    's     he Black Sea in a

elemen    s.- I    's a blas    ed hea    h.- I    's a Hyperborean win    er scene.-
I    's     he breaking-up of     he icebound s    ream of Time. Bu     las     all

fish? even     he grea     levia    han himself?

In fac    ,     he ar    is    's design seemed     his: a final     heory of my own,
par    ly based upon     he aggrega    ed opinions of many aged persons wi    h
whom I conversed upon     he subjec    . The pic    ure represen    s a
Cape-Horner in a grea     hurricane;     he half-foundered ship wel    ering
    here wi    h i    s     hree disman    led mas    s alone visible; and an
exaspera    ed whale, purposing     o spring clean over     he craf    , is in
    he enormous ac     of impaling himself upon     he     hree mas    -heads.

The opposi    e wall of     his en    ry was hung all over wi    h a hea    henish
array of mons    rous clubs and spears. Some were     hickly se     wi    h
gli        ering     ee    h resembling ivory saws; o    hers were     uf    ed wi    h kno    s
of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, wi    h a vas     handle sweeping
round like     he segmen     made in     he new-mown grass by a long-armed
mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered wha     mons    rous
cannibal and savage could ever have gone a dea    h-harves    ing wi    h such
a hacking, horrifying implemen    . Mixed wi    h     hese were rus    y old
whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were
s    oried weapons.  Wi    h     his once long lance, now wildly elbowed,
fif    y years ago did Na    han Swain kill fif    een whales be    ween a
sunrise and a sunse    . And     ha     harpoon- so like a corkscrew now- was
flung in Javan seas, and run away wi    h by a whale, years af    erwards
slain off     he Cape of Blanco. The original iron en    ered nigh     he
    ail, and, like a res    less needle sojourning in     he body of a man,
    ravelled full for    y fee    , and a     las     was found imbedded in     he
hump.

Crossing     his dusky en    ry, and on     hrough yon low-arched way- cu    
    hrough wha     in old     imes mus     have been a grea     cen    ral chimney wi    h
fireplaces all round- you en    er     he public room. A s    ill duskier
place is     his, wi    h such low ponderous beams above, and such old
wrinkled planks benea    h,     ha     you would almos     fancy you     rod some
old craf    's cockpi    s, especially of such a howling nigh    , when     his
corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side s    ood a
long, low, shelf-like     able covered wi    h cracked glass cases, filled
wi    h dus    y rari    ies ga    hered from     his wide world's remo    es     nooks.
Projec    ing from     he fur    her angle of     he room s    ands a dark-looking
den-     he bar- a rude a        emp     a     a righ     whale's head. Be     ha     how i    
may,     here s    ands     he vas     arched bone of     he whale's jaw, so wide, a
coach migh     almos     drive benea    h i    . Wi    hin are shabby shelves,
ranged round wi    h old decan    ers, bo        les, flasks; and in     hose jaws
of swif     des    ruc    ion, like ano    her cursed Jonah (by which name indeed
    hey called him), bus    les a li        le wi    hered old man, who, for     heir
money, dearly sells     he sailors deliriums and dea    h.

Abominable are     he     umblers in    o which he pours his poison. Though
    rue cylinders wi    hou    - wi    hin,     he villanous green goggling glasses
decei    fully     apered downwards     o a chea    ing bo        om. Parallel
meridians rudely pecked in    o     he glass, surround     hese foo    pads'
goble    s. Fill     o     his mark, and your charge is bu     a penny;     o     his a
penny more; and so on     o     he full glass-     he Cape Horn measure, which
you may gulp down for a shilling.

Upon en    ering     he place I found a number of young seamen ga    hered
abou     a     able, examining by a dim ligh     divers specimens of
skrimshander. I sough         he landlord, and     elling him I desired     o be
accommoda    ed wi    h a room, received for answer     ha     his house was
full- no     a bed unoccupied. "Bu     avas    ," he added,     apping his
forehead, "you hain     no objec    ions     o sharing a harpooneer's blanke    ,
have ye? I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd be        er ge     used
    o     ha     sor     of     hing."

I     old him     ha     I never liked     o sleep     wo in a bed;     ha     if I should
ever do so, i     would depend upon who     he harpooneer migh     be, and
    ha     if he (    he landlord) really had no o    her place for me, and     he
harpooneer was no     decidedly objec    ionable, why ra    her     han wander
fur    her abou     a s    range     own on so bi        er a nigh    , I would pu     up
wi    h     he half of any decen     man's blanke    .

"I     hough     so. All righ    ;     ake a sea    . Supper?- you wan     supper?
Supper'll be ready direc    ly."

I sa     down on an old wooden se        le, carved all over like a bench on
    he Ba        ery. A     one end a rumina    ing     ar was s    ill fur    her adorning
i     wi    h his jack-knife, s    ooping over and diligen    ly working away a    
    he space be    ween his legs. He was     rying his hand a     a ship under
full sail, bu     he didn'     make much headway, I     hough    .

A     las     some four or five of us were summoned     o our meal in an
adjoining room. I     was cold as Iceland- no fire a     all-     he landlord
said he couldn'     afford i    . No    hing bu         wo dismal     allow candles,
each in a winding shee    . We were fain     o bu        on up our monkey
jacke    s, and hold     o our lips cups of scalding     ea wi    h our half
frozen fingers. Bu         he fare was of     he mos     subs    an    ial kind- no    
only mea     and po    a    oes, bu     dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for
supper! One young fellow in a green box coa    , addressed himself     o
    hese dumplings in a mos     direful manner.

"My boy," said     he landlord, "you'll have     he nigh    mare     o a dead
sar    ain    y."

"Landlord," I whispered, "    ha     ain         he harpooneer is i    ?"

"Oh, no," said he, looking a sor     of diabolically funny, "    he
harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never ea    s dumplings, he
don'    - he ea    s no    hing bu     s    eaks, and he likes 'em rare."

"The devil he does," says I. "Where is     ha     harpooneer? Is he here?"

"He'll be here afore long," was     he answer.

I could no     help i    , bu     I began     o feel suspicious of     his "dark
complexioned" harpooneer. A     any ra    e, I made up my mind     ha     if i    
so     urned ou         ha     we should sleep     oge    her, he mus     undress and ge    
in    o bed before I did.

Supper over,     he company wen     back     o     he bar-room, when, knowing no    
wha     else     o do wi    h myself, I resolved     o spend     he res     of     he
evening as a looker on.

Presen    ly a rio    ing noise was heard wi    hou    . S    ar    ing up,     he
landlord cried, "Tha    's     he Grampus's crew. I seed her repor    ed in
    he offing     his morning; a     hree years' voyage, and a full
ship. Hurrah, boys; now we'll have     he la    es     news from     he Feegees."

A     ramping of sea boo    s was heard in     he en    ry;     he door was flung
open, and in rolled a wild se     of mariners enough. Enveloped in     heir
shaggy wa    ch coa    s, and wi    h     heir heads muffled in woollen
comfor    ers, all bedarned and ragged, and     heir beards s    iff wi    h
icicles,     hey seemed an erup    ion of bears from Labrador. They had
jus     landed from     heir boa    , and     his was     he firs     house     hey
en    ered. No wonder,     hen,     ha         hey made a s    raigh     wake for     he
whale's mou    h-     he bar- when     he wrinkled li        le old Jonah,     here
officia    ing, soon poured     hem ou     brimmers all round. One complained
of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pi    ch-like
po    ion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for
all colds and ca    arrhs wha    soever, never mind of how long s    anding,
or whe    her caugh     off     he coas     of Labrador, or on     he wea    her side
of an ice-island.

The liquor soon moun    ed in    o     heir heads, as i     generally does even
wi    h     he arran    es         opers newly landed from sea, and     hey began
capering abou     mos     obs    reperously.

I observed, however,     ha     one of     hem held somewha     aloof, and     hough
he seemed desirous no         o spoil     he hilari    y of his shipma    es by his
own sober face, ye     upon     he whole he refrained from making as much
noise as     he res    . This man in    eres    ed me a     once; and since     he
sea-gods had ordained     ha     he should soon become my shipma    e (    hough
bu     a sleeping par    ner one, so far as     his narra    ive is concerned), I
will here ven    ure upon a li        le descrip    ion of him. He s    ood full six
fee     in heigh    , wi    h noble shoulders, and a ches     like a
coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was
deeply brown and burn    , making his whi    e     ee    h dazzling by     he
con    ras    ; while in     he deep shadows of his eyes floa    ed some
reminiscences     ha     did no     seem     o give him much joy. His voice a    
once announced     ha     he was a Sou    herner, and from his fine s    a    ure, I
    hough     he mus     be one of     hose     all moun    aineers from     he
Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When     he revelry of his companions had
moun    ed     o i    s heigh    ,     his man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no
more of him     ill he became my comrade on     he sea. In a few minu    es,
however, he was missed by his shipma    es, and being, i     seems, for
some reason a huge favori    e wi    h     hem,     hey raised a cry of
"Bulking    on! Bulking    on! where's Bulking    on?" and dar    ed ou     of     he
house in pursui     of him.

I     was now abou     nine o'clock, and     he room seeming almos    
superna    urally quie     af    er     hese orgies, I began     o congra    ula    e
myself upon a li        le plan     ha     had occurred     o me jus     previous     o
    he en    rance of     he seamen.

No man prefers     o sleep     wo in a bed. In fac    , you would a good deal
ra    her no     sleep wi    h your own bro    her. I don'     know how i     is, bu    
people like     o be priva    e when     hey are sleeping. And when i     comes
    o sleeping wi    h an unknown s    ranger, in a s    range inn, in a s    range
    own, and     ha     s    ranger a harpooneer,     hen your objec    ions
indefini    ely mul    iply.  Nor was     here any ear    hly reason why I as a
sailor should sleep     wo in a bed, more     han anybody else; for sailors
no more sleep     wo in a bed a     sea,     han bachelor Kings do ashore. To
be sure     hey all sleep     oge    her in one apar    men    , bu     you have your
own hammock, and cover yourself wi    h your own blanke    , and sleep in
your own skin.

The more I pondered over     his harpooneer,     he more I abomina    ed     he
    hough     of sleeping wi    h him. I     was fair     o presume     ha     being a
harpooneer, his linen or woolen, as     he case migh     be, would no     be
of     he     idies    , cer    ainly none of     he fines    . I began     o     wi    ch all
over. Besides, i     was ge        ing la    e, and my decen     harpooneer ough         o
be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should     umble in upon me
a     midnigh    - how could I     ell from wha     vile hole he had been coming?

"Landlord! I've changed my mind abou         ha     harpooneer.- I shan'    
sleep wi    h him.  I'll     ry     he bench here."

"Jus     as you please; I'm sorry I can     spare ye a     ableclo    h for a
ma        ress, and i    's a plaguy rough board here"- feeling of     he kno    s
and no    ches. "Bu     wai     a bi    , Skrimshander; I've go     a carpen    er's
plane     here in     he bar- wai    , I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."
So saying he procured     he plane; and wi    h his old silk handkerchief
firs     dus    ing     he bench, vigorously se         o planing away a     my bed,
    he while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew righ     and lef    ;
    ill a     las         he plane-iron came bump agains     an indes    ruc    ible
kno    . The landlord was near spraining his wris    , and I     old him for
heaven's sake     o qui    -     he bed was sof     enough     o sui     me, and I did
no     know how all     he planing in     he world could make eider down of a
pine plank. So ga    hering up     he shavings wi    h ano    her grin, and
    hrowing     hem in    o     he grea     s    ove in     he middle of     he room, he wen    
abou     his business, and lef     me in a brown s    udy.

I now     ook     he measure of     he bench, and found     ha     i     was a foo         oo
shor    ; bu         ha     could be mended wi    h a chair. Bu     i     was a foo         oo
narrow, and     he o    her bench in     he room was abou     four inches higher
    han     he planed one- so     here was no yoking     hem. I     hen placed     he
firs     bench leng    hwise along     he only clear space agains         he wall,
leaving a li        le in    erval be    ween, for my back     o se        le down in. Bu    
I soon found     ha         here came such a draugh     of cold air over me from
under     he sill of     he window,     ha         his plan would never do a     all,
especially as ano    her curren     from     he ricke    y door me         he one from
    he window, and bo    h     oge    her formed a series of small whirlwinds in
    he immedia    e vicini    y of     he spo     where I had     hough         o spend     he
nigh    .

The devil fe    ch     ha     harpooneer,     hough     I, bu     s    op, couldn'     I
s    eal a march on him- bol     his door inside, and jump in    o his bed,
no         o be wakened by     he mos     violen     knockings? I     seemed no bad
idea bu     upon second     hough    s I dismissed i    . For who could     ell bu    
wha         he nex     morning, so soon as I popped ou     of     he room,     he
harpooneer migh     be s    anding in     he en    ry, all ready     o knock me
down!

S    ill looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
spending a sufferable nigh     unless in some o    her person's bed, I
began     o     hink     ha     af    er all I migh     be cherishing unwarran    able
prejudices agains         his unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wai    
awhile; he mus     be dropping in before long. I'll have a good look a    
him     hen, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows af    er all-
    here's no     elling.

Bu         hough     he o    her boarders kep     coming in by ones,     wos, and
    hrees, and going     o bed, ye     no sign of my harpooneer.

"Landlord! said I, "wha     sor     of a chap is he- does he always keep
such la    e hours?" I     was now hard upon     welve o'clock.

The landlord chuckled again wi    h his lean chuckle, and seemed     o be
migh    ily     ickled a     some    hing beyond my comprehension. "No," he
answered, "generally he's an early bird- airley     o bed and airley     o
rise- yea, he's     he bird wha     ca    ches     he worm.  Bu         o-nigh     he wen    
ou     a peddling, you see, and I don'     see wha     on air    h keeps him so
la    e, unless, may be, he can'     sell his head."

"Can'     sell his head?- Wha     sor     of a bamboozingly s    ory is     his you
are     elling me?" ge        ing in    o a     owering rage. "Do you pre    end     o
say, landlord,     ha         his harpooneer is ac    ually engaged     his blessed
Sa    urday nigh    , or ra    her Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
    his     own?"

"Tha    's precisely i    ," said     he landlord, "and I     old him he couldn'    
sell i     here,     he marke    's overs    ocked."

"Wi    h wha    ?" shou    ed I.

"Wi    h heads     o be sure; ain'         here     oo many heads in     he world?"

"I     ell you wha     i     is, landlord," said I qui    e calmly, "you'd be        er
s    op spinning     ha     yarn     o me- I'm no     green."

"May be no    ,"     aking ou     a s    ick and whi        ling a     oo    hpick, "bu     I
ray    her guess you'll be done brown if     ha     ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin' his head."

"I'll break i     for him," said I, now flying in    o a passion again a    
    his unaccoun    able farrago of     he landlord's.

"I    's broke a'ready," said he.

"Broke," said I- "broke, do you mean?"

"Sar    ain, and     ha    's     he very reason he can'     sell i    , I guess."

"Landlord," said I, going up     o him as cool as M    . Hecla in a
snows    orm- "landlord, s    op whi        ling. You and I mus     unders    and one

belongs     o a cer    ain harpooneer. And abou         his harpooneer, whom I
have no     ye     seen, you persis     in     elling me     he mos     mys    ifying and

highes     degree. I now demand of you     o speak ou     and     ell me who and
wha         his harpooneer is, and whe    her I shall be in all respec    s safe

no idea of sleeping wi    h a madman; and you, sir, you I mean,
landlord, you, sir, by     rying     o induce me     o do so knowingly would
    hereby render yourself liable     o a criminal prosecu    ion."

"Wall," said     he landlord, fe    ching a long brea    h, "    ha    's a pur    y
long sarmon for a chap     ha     rips a li        le now and     hen. Bu     be easy,
be easy,     his here harpooneer I have been     ellin' you of has jus    
arrived from     he sou    h seas, where he bough     up a lo     of 'balmed New
Zealand heads (grea     curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em bu    
one, and     ha     one he's     rying     o sell     o-nigh    , cause     o-morrow's

heads s    rung on a s    ring, for all     he air    h like a s    ring of inions."

This accoun     cleared up     he o    herwise unaccoun    able mys    ery, and
showed     ha         he landlord, af    er all, had had no idea of fooling me-
bu     a         he same     ime wha     could I     hink of a harpooneer who s    ayed
ou     of a Sa    urday nigh     clean in    o     he holy Sabba    h, engaged in such
a cannibal business as selling     he heads of dead idola    ors?

"Depend upon i    , landlord,     ha     harpooneer is a dangerous man."

"He pays reg'lar," was     he rejoinder. "Bu     come, i    's a nice bed: Sal
and me slep     in     ha     ere bed     he nigh     we were spliced. There's
plen    y of room for     wo     o kick abou     in     ha     bed; i    's an almigh    y
big bed     ha    . Why, afore we give i     up, Sal used     o pu     our Sam and
li        le Johnny in     he foo     of i    . Bu     I go     a dreaming and sprawling
abou     one nigh    , and somehow, Sam go     pi    ched on     he floor, and came
near breaking his arm. Ar    er     ha    , Sal said i     wouldn'     do. Come
along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he ligh    ed
a candle and held i         owards me, offering     o lead     he way. Bu     I
s    ood irresolu    e; when looking a     a clock in     he corner, he exclaimed
"I vum i    's Sunday- you won'     see     ha     harpooneer     o-nigh    ; he's come
    o anchor somewhere- come along     hen; do come; won'     ye come?"

I considered     he ma        er a momen    , and     hen up s    airs we wen    , and I
was ushered in    o a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure
enough, wi    h a prodigious bed, almos     big enough indeed for any four
harpooneers     o sleep abreas    .

"There," said     he landlord, placing     he candle on a crazy old sea
ches         ha     did double du    y as a wash-s    and and cen    re     able; "    here,
make yourself comfor    able now; and good nigh         o ye." I     urned round
from eyeing     he bed, bu     he had disappeared.

Folding back     he coun    erpane, I s    ooped over     he bed. Though none of
    he mos     elegan    , i     ye     s    ood     he scru    iny     olerably well. I     hen
glanced round     he room; and besides     he beds    ead and cen    re     able,
could see no o    her furni    ure belonging     o     he place, bu     a rude
shelf,     he four walls, and a papered fireboard represen    ing a man
s    riking a whale. Of     hings no     properly belonging     o     he room,     here
was a hammock lashed up, and     hrown upon     he floor in one corner;
also a large seaman's bag, con    aining     he harpooneer's wardrobe, no
doub     in lieu of a land     runk. Likewise,     here was a parcel of
ou    landish bone fish hooks on     he shelf over     he fire-place, and a
    all harpoon s    anding a         he head of     he bed.

Bu     wha     is     his on     he ches    ? I     ook i     up, and held i     close     o     he
ligh    , and fel     i    , and smel     i    , and     ried every way possible     o
arrive a     some sa    isfac    ory conclusion concerning i    . I can compare
i         o no    hing bu     a large door ma    , ornamen    ed a         he edges wi    h
li        le     inkling     ags some    hing like     he s    ained porcupine quills
round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or sli     in     he middle of
    his ma    , as you see     he same in Sou    h American ponchos. Bu     could i    
be possible     ha     any sober harpooneer would ge     in    o a door ma    , and
parade     he s    ree    s of any Chris    ian     own in     ha     sor     of guise? I pu    
i     on,     o     ry i    , and i     weighed me down like a hamper, being
uncommonly shaggy and     hick, and I     hough     a li        le damp, as     hough
    his mys    erious harpooneer had been wearing i     of a rainy day. I wen    
up in i         o a bi     of glass s    uck agains         he wall, and I never saw
such a sigh     in my life. I     ore myself ou     of i     in such a hurry     ha    
I gave myself a kink in     he neck.

I sa     down on     he side of     he bed, and commenced     hinking abou         his
head-peddling harpooneer, and his door ma    . Af    er     hinking some     ime
on     he bed-side, I go     up and     ook off my monkey jacke    , and     hen
s    ood in     he middle of     he room     hinking. I     hen     ook off my coa    ,
and     hough     a li        le more in my shir     sleeves. Bu     beginning     o feel
very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering wha         he
landlord said abou         he harpooneer's no     coming home a     all     ha    
nigh    , i     being so very la    e, I made no more ado, bu     jumped ou     of
my pan    aloons and boo    s, and     hen blowing ou         he ligh         umbled in    o
bed, and commended myself     o     he care of heaven.

Whe    her     ha     ma        ress was s    uffed wi    h corncobs or broken crockery,
    here is no     elling, bu     I rolled abou     a good deal, and could no    
sleep for a long     ime. A     las     I slid off in    o a ligh     doze, and had
pre        y nearly made a good offing     owards     he land of Nod, when I
heard a heavy foo    fall in     he passage, and saw a glimmer of ligh    
come in    o     he room from under     he door.

Lord save me,     hinks I,     ha     mus     be     he harpooneer,     he infernal
head-peddler. Bu     I lay perfec    ly s    ill, and resolved no         o say a
word     ill spoken     o. Holding a ligh     in one hand, and     ha     iden    ical
New Zealand head in     he o    her,     he s    ranger en    ered     he room, and
wi    hou     looking     owards     he bed, placed his candle a good way off
from me on     he floor in one corner, and     hen began working away a    
    he kno        ed cords of     he large bag I before spoke of as being in     he
room. I was all eagerness     o see his face, bu     he kep     i     aver    ed for
some     ime while employed in unlacing     he bag's mou    h. This
accomplished, however, he     urned round- when, good heavens; wha     a
sigh    ! Such a face! I     was of a dark, purplish, yellow color, here
and     here s    uck over wi    h large blackish looking squares. Yes, i    's
jus     as I     hough    , he's a     errible bedfellow; he's been in a figh    ,
go     dreadfully cu    , and here he is, jus     from     he surgeon. Bu     a    
    ha     momen     he chanced     o     urn his face so     owards     he ligh    ,     ha     I
plainly saw     hey could no     be s    icking-plas    ers a     all,     hose black
squares on his cheeks. They were s    ains of some sor     or o    her. A    
firs     I knew no     wha         o make of     his; bu     soon an inkling of     he
    ru    h occurred     o me. I remembered a s    ory of a whi    e man- a whaleman
    oo- who, falling among     he cannibals, had been     a        ooed by     hem. I
concluded     ha         his harpooneer, in     he course of his dis    an     voyages,
mus     have me     wi    h a similar adven    ure. And wha     is i    ,     hough     I,
af    er all! I    's only his ou    side; a man can be hones     in any sor     of
skin. Bu         hen, wha         o make of his unear    hly complexion,     ha     par    
of i    , I mean, lying round abou    , and comple    ely independen     of     he
squares of     a        ooing. To be sure, i     migh     be no    hing bu     a good coa    
of     ropical     anning; bu     I never heard of a ho     sun's     anning a whi    e
man in    o a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in     he
Sou    h Seas; and perhaps     he sun     here produced     hese ex    raordinary
effec    s upon     he skin. Now, while all     hese ideas were passing
    hrough me like ligh    ning,     his harpooneer never no    iced me a    
all. Bu    , af    er some difficul    y having opened his bag, he commenced
fumbling in i    , and presen    ly pulled ou     a sor     of     omahawk, and a
seal-skin walle     wi    h     he hair on. Placing     hese on     he old ches     in
    he middle of a room, he     hen     ook     he New Zealand head- a ghas    ly
    hing enough- and crammed i     down in    o     he bag. He now     ook off his
ha    - a new beaver ha    - when I came nigh singing ou     wi    h fresh
surprise.  There was no hair on his head- none     o speak of a     leas    -
no    hing bu     a small scalp-kno         wis    ed up on his forehead. His bald
purplish head now looked for all     he world like a mildewed skull. Had
no         he s    ranger s    ood be    ween me and     he door, I would have bol    ed
ou     of i     quicker     han ever I bol    ed a dinner.

Even as i     was, I     hough     some    hing of slipping ou     of     he window,
bu     i     was     he second floor back. I am no coward, bu     wha         o make of
    his headpeddling purple rascal al    oge    her passed my
comprehension. Ignorance is     he paren     of fear, and being comple    ely
nonplussed and confounded abou         he s    ranger, I confess I was now as
much afraid of him as if i     was     he devil himself who had     hus broken
in    o my room a         he dead of nigh    . In fac    , I was so afraid of him
    ha     I was no     game enough jus         hen     o address him, and demand a
sa    isfac    ory answer concerning wha     seemed inexplicable in him.

Meanwhile, he con    inued     he business of undressing, and a     las    
showed his ches     and arms. As I live,     hese covered par    s of him were
checkered wi    h     he same squares as his face, his back,     oo, was all
over     he same dark squares; he seemed     o have been in a Thir    y Years'
War, and jus     escaped from i     wi    h a s    icking-plas    er shir    . S    ill
more, his very legs were marked, as a parcel of dark green frogs were
running up     he     runks of young palms. I     was now qui    e plain     ha     he
mus     be some abominable savage or o    her shipped aboard of a whaleman
in     he Sou    h Seas, and so landed in     his Chris    ian coun    ry. I quaked
    o     hink of i    . A peddler of heads     oo- perhaps     he heads of his own
bro    hers. He migh         ake a fancy     o mine- heavens! look a         ha    
    omahawk!

Bu         here was no     ime for shuddering, for now     he savage wen     abou    
some    hing     ha     comple    ely fascina    ed my a        en    ion, and convinced me
    ha     he mus     indeed be a hea    hen.  Going     o his heavy grego, or
wrapall, or dreadnaugh    , which he had previously hung on a chair, he
fumbled in     he pocke    s, and produced a     leng    h a curious li        le
deformed image wi    h a hunch on i    s back, and exac    ly     he color of a
    hree days' old Congo baby.  Remembering     he embalmed head, a     firs    
I almos         hough         ha         his black manikin was a real baby preserved
some similar manner. Bu     seeing     ha     i     was no     a     all limber, and
    ha     i     glis    ened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded     ha    
i     mus     be no    hing bu     a wooden idol, which indeed i     proved     o
be. For now     he savage goes up     o     he emp    y fire-place, and removing
    he papered fire-board, se    s up     his li        le hunch-backed image, like
a     enpin, be    ween     he andirons. The chimney jambs and all     he bricks
inside were very soo    y, so     ha     I     hough         his fire-place made a very
appropria    e li        le shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

I now screwed my eyes hard     owards     he half hidden image, feeling bu    
ill a     ease mean    ime-     o see wha     was nex         o follow. Firs     he     akes
abou     a double handful of shavings ou     of his grego pocke    , and
places     hem carefully before     he idol;     hen laying a bi     of ship
biscui     on     op and applying     he flame from     he lamp, he kindled     he
shavings in    o a sacrificial blaze. Presen    ly, af    er many has    y
sna    ches in    o     he fire, and s    ill has    ier wi    hdrawals of his fingers
(whereby he seemed     o be scorching     hem badly), he a     las     succeeded
in drawing ou         he biscui    ;     hen blowing off     he hea     and ashes a
li        le, he made a poli    e offer of i         o     he li        le negro. Bu         he
li        le devil did no     seem     o fancy such dry sor     of fare a     all; he
never moved his lips. All     hese s    range an    ics were accompanied by
s    ill s    ranger gu        ural noises from     he devo    ee, who seemed     o be
praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or o    her,
during which his face     wi    ched abou     in     he mos     unna    ural manner. A    
las     ex    inguishing     he fire, he     ook     he idol up very
unceremoniously, and bagged i     again in his grego pocke     as
carelessly as if he were a spor    sman bagging a dead woodcock.

All     hese queer proceedings increased my uncomfor    ableness, and
seeing him now exhibi    ing s    rong symp    oms of concluding his business
opera    ions, and jumping in    o bed wi    h me, I     hough     i     was high     ime,
now or never, before     he ligh     was pu     ou    ,     o break     he spell in
which I had so long been bound.

Bu         he in    erval I spen     in delibera    ing wha         o say, was a fa    al
one. Taking up his     omahawk from     he     able, he examined     he head of
i     for an ins    an    , and     hen holding i         o     he ligh    , wi    h his mou    h
a         he handle, he puffed ou     grea     clouds of     obacco smoke. The nex    
momen         he ligh     was ex    inguished, and     his wild cannibal,     omahawk
be    ween his     ee    h, sprang in    o bed wi    h me. I sang ou    , I could no    
help i     now; and giving a sudden grun     of as    onishmen     he began
feeling me.

S    ammering ou     some    hing, I knew no     wha    , I rolled away from him
agains         he wall, and     hen conjured him, whoever or wha    ever he migh    
be,     o keep quie    , and le     me ge     up and ligh         he lamp again. Bu    
his gu        ural responses sa    isfied me a     once     ha     he bu     ill
comprehended my meaning.

"Who-e debel you?"- he a     las     said- "you no speak-e, dam-me, I
kill-e." And so saying     he ligh    ed     omahawk began flourishing abou    
me in     he dark.

"Landlord, for God's sake, Pe    er Coffin!" shou    ed I. "Landlord!
Wa    ch!  Coffin! Angels! save me!"

"Speak-e!     ell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled
    he cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of     he     omahawk sca        ered
    he ho         obacco ashes abou     me     ill I     hough     my linen would ge     on
fire. Bu         hank heaven, a         ha     momen         he landlord came in    o     he
room ligh     in hand, and leaping from     he bed I ran up     o him.

"Don'     be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here
wouldn'     harm a hair of your head."

"S    op your grinning," shou    ed I, "and why didn'     you     ell me     ha    
    ha     infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"

"I     hough     ye know'd i    ;- didn'     I     ell ye, he was a peddlin' heads
around     own?- bu         urn flukes again and go     o sleep. Queequeg, look
here- you sabbee me, I sabbee- you     his man sleepe you- you sabbee?"

"Me sabbee plen    y"- grun    ed Queequeg, puffing away a     his pipe and
si        ing up in bed.

"You ge        ee in," he added, mo    ioning     o me wi    h his     omahawk, and
    hrowing     he clo    hes     o one side. He really did     his in no     only a
civil bu     a really kind and chari    able way. I s    ood looking a     him a
momen    . For all his     a        ooings he was on     he whole a clean, comely
looking cannibal. Wha    's all     his fuss I have been making abou    ,
    hough     I     o myself-     he man's a human being jus     as I am: he has
jus     as much reason     o fear me, as I have     o be afraid of him. Be        er
sleep wi    h a sober cannibal     han a drunken Chris    ian.

"Landlord," said I, "    ell him     o s    ash his     omahawk     here, or pipe,
or wha    ever you call i    ;     ell him     o s    op smoking, in shor    , and I
will     urn in wi    h him. Bu     I don'     fancy having a man smoking in bed
wi    h me. I    's dangerous. Besides, I ain'     insured."

This being     old     o Queequeg, he a     once complied, and again poli    ely
mo    ioned me     o ge     in    o bed- rolling over     o one side as much as     o
say- I won'         ouch a leg of ye."

"Good nigh    , landlord," said I, "you may go."

I     urned in, and never slep     be        er in my life.




The Coun    erpane


Upon waking nex     morning abou     dayligh    , I found Queequeg's arm
    hrown over me in     he mos     loving and affec    iona    e manner. You had
almos         hough     I had been his wife. The coun    erpane was of pa    chwork,
full of odd li        le par    i-colored squares and     riangles; and     his arm
of his     a        ooed all over wi    h an in    erminable Cre    an labyrin    h of a
figure, no     wo par    s of which were of one precise shade- owing I
suppose     o his keeping his arm a     sea unme    hodically in sun and
shade, his shir     sleeves irregularly rolled up a     various     imes-     his
same arm of his, I say, looked for all     he world like a s    rip of     ha    
same pa    chwork quil    . Indeed, par    ly lying on i     as     he arm did when
I firs     awoke, I could hardly     ell i     from     he quil    ,     hey so blended
    heir hues     oge    her; and i     was only by     he sense of weigh     and
pressure     ha     I could     ell     ha     Queequeg was hugging me.

My sensa    ions were s    range. Le     me     ry     o explain     hem. When I was a
child, I well remember a somewha     similar circums    ance     ha     befell
me; whe    her i     was a reali    y or a dream, I never could en    irely
se        le. The circums    ance was     his. I had been cu        ing up some caper
or o    her- I     hink i     was     rying     o crawl up     he chimney, as I had
seen a li        le sweep do a few days previous; and my s    epmo    her who,
somehow or o    her, was all     he     ime whipping me, or sending me     o bed
supperless,- my mo    her dragged me by     he legs ou     of     he chimney and
packed me off     o bed,     hough i     was only     wo o'clock in     he af    ernoon
of     he 21s     June,     he longes     day in year in our hemisphere. I fel    
dreadfully. Bu         here was no help for i    , so up s    airs I wen         o my
li        le room in     he     hird floor, undressed myself as slowly as
possible so as     o kill     ime, and wi    h a bi        er sigh go     be    ween     he
shee    s.

I lay     here dismally calcula    ing     ha     six    een en    ire hours mus    
elapse before I could hope for a resurrec    ion. Six    een hours in bed!
    he small of my back ached     o     hink of i    .  And i     was so ligh         oo;
    he sun shining in a         he window, and a grea     ra        ling of coaches in
    he s    ree    s, and     he sound of gay voices all over     he house. I fel    
worse and worse- a     las     I go     up, dressed, and sof    ly going down in
my s    ockinged fee    , sough     ou     my s    epmo    her, and suddenly     hrew
myself a     her fee    , beseeching her as a par    icular favor     o give me a
good slippering for my misbehaviour: any    hing indeed bu     condemning
me     o lie abed such an unendurable leng    h of     ime. Bu     she was     he
bes     and mos     conscien    ious of s    epmo    hers, and back I had     o go     o
my room. For several hours I lay     here broad awake, feeling a grea    
deal worse     han I have ever done since, even from     he grea    es    
subsequen     misfor    unes. A     las     I mus     have fallen in    o a     roubled
nigh    mare of a doze; and slowly waking from i    - half s    eeped in
dreams- I opened my eyes, and     he before sunli     room was now wrapped
in ou    er darkness. Ins    an    ly I fel     a shock running     hrough all my
frame; no    hing was     o be seen, and no    hing was     o be heard; bu     a
superna    ural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over     he
coun    erpane, and     he nameless, unimaginable, silen     form or phan    om,
    o which     he hand belonged, seemed closely sea    ed by my bed-side. For
wha     seemed ages piled on ages, I lay     here, frozen wi    h     he mos    
awful fears, no     daring     o drag away my hand; ye     ever     hinking     ha    
if I could bu     s    ir i     one single inch,     he horrid spell would be
broken. I knew no     how     his consciousness a     las     glided away from
me; bu     waking in     he morning, I shudderingly remembered i     all, and
for days and weeks and mon    hs af    erwards I los     myself in confounding
a        emp    s     o explain     he mys    ery. Nay,     o     his very hour, I of    en
puzzle myself wi    h i    .

Now,     ake away     he awful fear, and my sensa    ions a     feeling     he
superna    ural hand in mine were very similar, in     he s    rangeness,     o
    hose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
arm     hrown round me. Bu     a     leng    h all     he pas     nigh    's even    s
soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reali    y, and     hen I lay only
alive     o     he comical predicamen    . For     hough I     ried     o move his arm-
unlock his bridegroom clasp- ye    , sleeping as he was, he s    ill hugged
me     igh    ly, as     hough naugh     bu     dea    h should par     us     wain. I now
s    rove     o rouse him- "Queequeg!"- bu     his only answer was a snore.  I
    hen rolled over, my neck feeling as if i     were in a horse-collar;
and suddenly fel     a sligh     scra    ch. Throwing aside     he coun    erpane,
    here lay     he     omahawk sleeping by     he savage's side, as if i     were a
ha    che    -faced baby. A pre        y pickle,     ruly,     hough     I; abed here in a
s    range house in     he broad day, wi    h a cannibal and a     omahawk!
"Queequeg!- in     he name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!" A     leng    h, by
din     of much wriggling, and loud and incessan     expos    ula    ions upon
    he unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in     ha     ma    rimonial
sor     of s    yle, I succeeded in ex    rac    ing a grun    ; and presen    ly, he
drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog
jus     from     he wa    er, and sa     up in bed, s    iff as a pike-s    aff,
looking a     me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did no     al    oge    her
remember how I came     o be     here,     hough a dim consciousness of
knowing some    hing abou     me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile,
I lay quie    ly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and ben    
upon narrowly observing so curious a crea    ure.  When, a     las    , his
mind seemed made up     ouching     he charac    er of his bedfellow, and he
became, as i     were, reconciled     o     he fac    ; he jumped ou     upon     he
floor, and by cer    ain signs and sounds gave me     o unders    and     ha    , if
i     pleased me, he would dress firs     and     hen leave me     o dress
af    erwards, leaving     he whole apar    men         o myself. Thinks I,
Queequeg, under     he circums    ances,     his is a very civilized over    ure;
bu    ,     he     ru    h is,     hese savages have an inna    e sense of delicacy,
say wha     you will; i     is marvellous how essen    ially poli    e     hey
are. I pay     his par    icular complimen         o Queequeg, because he     rea    ed
me wi    h so much civili    y and considera    ion, while I was guil    y of
grea     rudeness; s    aring a     him from     he bed, and wa    ching all his
    oile        e mo    ions; for     he     ime my curiosi    y ge        ing     he be        er of my
breeding. Never    heless, a man like Queequeg you don'     see every day,
he and his ways were well wor    h unusual regarding.

He commenced dressing a         op by donning his beaver ha    , a very     all
one, by     he by, and     hen- s    ill minus his     rowsers- he hun    ed up his
boo    s. Wha     under     he heavens he did i     for, I canno         ell, bu     his
nex     movemen     was     o crush himself- boo    s in hand, and ha     on- under
    he bed; when, from sundry violen     gaspings and s    rainings, I
inferred he was hard a     work boo    ing himself;     hough by no law of
proprie    y     ha     I ever heard of, is any man required     o be priva    e
when pu        ing on his boo    s. Bu     Queequeg, do you see, was a crea    ure
in     he     ransi    ion s    age- nei    her ca    erpillar nor bu        erfly. He was
jus     enough civilized     o show off his ou    landishness in     he s    ranges    
possible manners. His educa    ion was no     ye     comple    ed. He was an
undergradua    e. If he had no     been a small degree civilized, he very
probably would no     have     roubled himself wi    h boo    s a     all; bu         hen,
if he had no     been s    ill a savage, he never would have dream     of
ge        ing under     he bed     o pu         hem on.  A     las    , he emerged wi    h his
ha     very much den    ed and crushed down over his eyes, and began
creaking and limping abou         he room, as if, no     being much accus    omed
    o boo    s, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones- probably no     made
    o order ei    her- ra    her pinched and     ormen    ed him a         he firs     go off
of a bi        er cold morning.

Seeing, now,     ha         here were no cur    ains     o     he window, and     ha         he
s    ree     being very narrow,     he house opposi    e commanded a plain view
in    o     he room, and observing more and more     he indecorous figure     ha    
Queequeg made, s    aving abou     wi    h li        le else bu     his ha     and boo    s
on; I begged him as well as I could,     o accelera    e his     oile    
somewha    , and par    icularly     o ge     in    o his pan    aloons as soon as
possible. He complied, and     hen proceeded     o wash himself. A         ha    
    ime in     he morning any Chris    ian would have washed his face; bu    
Queequeg,     o my amazemen    , con    en    ed himself wi    h res    ric    ing his
ablu    ions     o his ches    , arms, and hands. He     hen donned his
wais    coa    , and     aking up a piece of hard soap on     he wash-s    and
cen    re     able, dipped i     in    o wa    er and commenced la    hering his
face. I was wa    ching     o see where he kep     his razor, when lo and
behold, he     akes     he harpoon from     he bed corner, slips ou         he long
wooden s    ock, unshea    hes     he head, whe    s i     a li        le on his boo    , and
s    riding up     o     he bi     of mirror agains         he wall, begins a vigorous
scraping, or ra    her harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg,
    his is using Rogers's bes     cu    lery wi    h a vengeance. Af    erwards I
wondered     he less a         his opera    ion when I came     o know of wha     fine
s    eel     he head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp     he
long s    raigh     edges are always kep    .

The res     of his     oile     was soon achieved, and he proudly marched ou    
of     he room, wrapped up in his grea     pilo     monkey jacke    , and
spor    ing his harpoon like a marshal's ba    on.




Breakfas    


I quickley followed sui    , and descending in    o     he bar-room accos    ed
    he grinning landlord very pleasan    ly. I cherished no malice     owards
him,     hough he had been skylarking wi    h me no     a li        le in     he ma        er
of my bedfellow.

However, a good laugh is a migh    y good     hing, and ra    her     oo scarce a
good     hing;     he more's     he pi    y. So, if any one man, in his own
proper person, afford s    uff for a good joke     o anybody, le     him no    
be backward, bu     le     him cheerfully allow himself     o spend and     o be
spen     in     ha     way. And     he man     ha     has any    hing boun    ifully
laughable abou     him, be sure     here is more in     ha     man     han you
perhaps     hink for.

The bar-room was now full of     he boarders who had been dropping in
    he nigh     previous, and whom I had no     as ye     had a good look
a    . They were nearly all whalemen; chief ma    es, and second ma    es, and
    hird ma    es, and sea carpen    ers, and sea coopers, and sea
blacksmi    hs, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny
company, wi    h bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy se    , all wearing
monkey jacke    s for morning gowns.

You could pre        y plainly     ell how long each one had been ashore. This
young fellow's heal    hy cheek is like a sun-    oas    ed pear in hue, and
would seem     o smell almos     as musky; he canno     have been     hree days
landed from his Indian voyage. Tha     man nex     him looks a few shades
ligh    er; you migh     say a     ouch of sa    in wood is in him. In     he
complexion of a     hird s    ill lingers a     ropic     awn, bu     sligh    ly
bleached wi    hal; he doub    less has     arried whole weeks ashore. Bu     who
could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred wi    h various     in    s,
seemed like     he Andes' wes    ern slope,     o show for    h in one array,
con    ras    ing clima    es, zone by zone.

"Grub, ho!" now cried     he landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
wen         o breakfas    .

They say     ha     men who have seen     he world,     hereby become qui    e a    
ease in manner, qui    e self-possessed in company. No     always,     hough:
Ledyard,     he grea     New England     raveller, and Mungo Park,     he Sco    ch
one; of all men,     hey possessed     he leas     assurance in     he
parlor. Bu     perhaps     he mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by
dogs as Ledyard did, or     he     aking a long soli    ary walk on an emp    y
s    omach, in     he negro hear     of Africa, which was     he sum of poor
Mungo's performances-     his kind of     ravel, I say, may no     be     he very
bes     mode of a        aining a high social polish. S    ill, for     he mos    
par    ,     ha     sor     of     hing is     o be had anywhere.

These reflec    ions jus     here are occasioned by     he circums    ance     ha    
af    er we were all sea    ed a         he     able, and I was preparing     o hear
some good s    ories abou     whaling;     o my no small surprise nearly every
man main    ained a profound silence. And no     only     ha    , bu         hey looked
embarrassed. Yes, here were a se     of sea-dogs, many of whom wi    hou    
    he sligh    es     bashfulness had boarded grea     whales on     he high seas-
en    ire s    rangers     o     hem- and duelled     hem dead wi    hou     winking; and
ye    , here     hey sa     a     a social breakfas         able- all of     he same
calling, all of kindred     as    es- looking round as sheepishly a     each
o    her as     hough     hey had never been ou     of sigh     of some sheepfold
among     he Green Moun    ains. A curious sigh    ;     hese bashful bears,
    hese     imid warrior whalemen!

Bu     as for Queequeg- why, Queequeg sa         here among     hem- a         he head
of     he     able,     oo, i     so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
canno     say much for his breeding. His grea    es     admirer could no     have
cordially jus    ified his bringing his harpoon in    o breakfas     wi    h him,
and using i         here wi    hou     ceremony; reaching over     he     able wi    h i    ,
    o     he imminen     jeopardy of many heads, and grappling     he beefs    eaks
    owards him. Bu         ha     was cer    ainly very coolly done by him, and
every one knows     ha     in mos     people's es    ima    ion,     o do any    hing
coolly is     o do i     gen    eelly.

We will no     speak of all Queequeg's peculiari    ies here; how he
eschewed coffee and ho     rolls, and applied his undivided a        en    ion     o
beefs    eaks, done rare. Enough,     ha     when breakfas     was over he
wi    hdrew like     he res     in    o     he public room, ligh    ed his
    omahawk-pipe, and was si        ing     here quie    ly diges    ing and smoking
wi    h his inseparable ha     on, when I sallied ou     for a s    roll.




The S    ree    


If I had been as    onished a     firs     ca    ching a glimpse of so ou    landish
an individual as Queequeg circula    ing among     he poli    e socie    y of a
civilized     own,     ha     as    onishmen     soon depar    ed upon     aking my firs    
dayligh     s    roll     hrough     he s    ree    s of New Bedford.

In     horoughfares nigh     he docks, any considerable seapor     will
frequen    ly offer     o view     he queeres     looking nondescrip    s from
foreign par    s. Even in Broadway and Ches    nu     s    ree    s, Medi    erranean
mariners will some    imes jos    le     he affrigh    ed ladies. Regen     S    ree    
is no     unknown     o Lascars and Malays; and a     Bombay, in     he Apollo
Green, live Yankees have of    en scared     he na    ives. Bu     New Bedford
bea    s all Wa    er S    ree     and Wapping. In     hese las    -men    ioned haun    s
you see only sailors; in New Bedford, ac    ual cannibals s    and cha        ing
a     s    ree     corners; savages ou    righ    ; many of whom ye     carry on     heir
bones unholy flesh. I     makes a s    ranger s    are.

Bu    , besides     he Feegeeans, Tonga    obooarrs, Erromanggoans,
Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides     he wild specimens of     he
whaling-craf     which unheeded reel abou         he s    ree    s, you will see
o    her sigh    s s    ill more curious, cer    ainly more comical.  There
weekly arrive in     his     own scores of green Vermon    ers and New
Hampshire men, all a    hirs     for gain and glory in     he fishery. They
are mos    ly young, of s    alwar     frames; fellows who have felled
fores    s, and now seek     o drop     he axe and sna    ch     he whale-lance.
Many are as green as     he Green Moun    ains whence     hey came. In some
    hings you would     hink     hem bu     a few hours old. Look     here!     ha    
chap s    ru        ing round     he corner. He wears a beaver ha     and
swallow-    ailed coa    , girdled wi    h a sailor-bel     and a
shea    h-knife. Here comes ano    her wi    h a sou'-wes    er and a bombazine
cloak.

No     own-bred dandy will compare wi    h a coun    ry-bred one- I mean a
downrigh     bumpkin dandy- a fellow     ha    , in     he dog-days, will mow his
    wo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of     anning his hands. Now when
a coun    ry dandy like     his     akes i     in    o his head     o make a
dis    inguished repu    a    ion, and joins     he grea     whale-fishery, you
should see     he comical     hings he does upon reaching     he seapor    . In
bespeaking his sea-ou    fi    , he orders bell-bu        ons     o his wais    coa    s;
s    raps     o his canvas     rowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bi        erly will
burs         hose s    raps in     he firs     howling gale, when     hou ar     driven,
s    raps, bu        ons, and all, down     he     hroa     of     he     empes    .

Bu         hink no         ha         his famous     own has only harpooneers, cannibals,
and bumpkins     o show her visi    ors. No     a     all. S    ill New Bedford is a
queer place. Had i     no     been for us whalemen,     ha         rac     of land
would     his day perhaps have been in as howling condi    ion as     he coas    
of Labrador. As i     is, par    s of her back coun    ry are enough     o
frigh    en one,     hey look so bony. The     own i    self is perhaps     he
deares     place     o live in, in all New England. I     is a land of oil,
    rue enough: bu     no     like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The
s    ree    s do no     run wi    h milk; nor in     he spring-    ime do     hey pave
    hem wi    h fresh eggs. Ye    , in spi    e of     his, nowhere in all America
will you find more pa    rician-like houses; parks and gardens more
opulen    ,     han in New Bedford. Whence came     hey? how plan    ed upon     his
once scraggy scoria of a coun    ry?

Go and gaze upon     he iron emblema    ical harpoons round yonder lof    y
mansion, and your ques    ion will be answered. Yes; all     hese brave
houses and flowery gardens came from     he A    lan    ic, Pacific, and
Indian oceans. One and all,     hey were harpooned and dragged up hi    her
from     he bo        om of     he sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a fea     like
    ha    ?

In New Bedford, fa    hers,     hey say, give whales for dowers     o     heir
daugh    ers, and por    ion off     heir nieces wi    h a few porpoises
a-piece. You mus     go     o New Bedford     o see a brillian     wedding; for,
    hey say,     hey have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every nigh    
recklessly burn     heir leng    hs in spermace    i candles.

In summer     ime,     he     own is swee         o see; full of fine maples- long
avenues of green and gold. And in Augus    , high in air,     he beau    iful
and boun    iful horse-ches    nu    s, candelabra-wise, proffer     he passer-by
    heir     apering uprigh     cones of congrega    ed blossoms. So omnipo    en    
is ar    ; which in many a dis    ric     of New Bedford has superinduced
brigh         erraces o     flowers upon     he barren refuse rocks     hrown aside
a     crea    ion's final day.

And     he women of New Bedford,     hey bloom like     heir own red
roses. Bu     roses only bloom in summer; whereas     he fine carna    ion of
    heir cheeks is perennial as sunligh     in     he seven    h
heavens. Elsewhere ma    ch     ha     bloom of     heirs, ye canno    , save in
Salem, where     hey     ell me     he young girls brea    he such musk,     heir
sailor swee    hear    s smell     hem miles off shore, as     hough     hey were
drawing nigh     he odorous Moluccas ins    ead of     he Puri    anic sands.




The Chapel


In     he same New Bedford     here s    ands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few are
    he moody fishermen, shor    ly bound for     he Indian Ocean or Pacific,
who fail     o make a Sunday visi         o     he spo    . I am sure     ha     I did
no    .

Re    urning from my firs     morning s    roll, I again sallied ou     upon     his
special errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold,     o
driving slee     and mis    . Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacke     of     he
clo    h called bearskin, I fough     my way agains         he s    ubborn s    orm.
En    ering, I found a small sca        ered congrega    ion of sailors, and
sailors' wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken a    
    imes by     he shrieks of     he s    orm. Each silen     worshipper seemed
purposely si        ing apar     from     he o    her, as if each silen     grief were
insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had no     ye     arrived; and
    here     hese silen     islands of men and women sa     s    eadfas    ly eyeing
several marble     able    s, wi    h black borders, masoned in    o     he wall on

Shaking off     he slee     from my ice-glazed ha     and jacke    , I sea    ed
myself near     he door, and     urning sideways was surprised     o see
Queequeg near me. Affec    ed by     he solemni    y of     he scene,     here was a
wondering gaze of incredulous curiosi    y in his coun    enance. This
savage was     he only person presen     who seemed     o no    ice my en    rance;
because he was     he only one who could no     read, and,     herefore, was
no     reading     hose frigid inscrip    ions on     he wall. Whe    her any of     he
rela    ives of     he seamen whose names appeared     here were now among     he
congrega    ion, I knew no    ; bu     so many are     he unrecorded acciden    s in
    he fishery, and so plainly did several women presen     wear     he
coun    enance if no         he     rappings of some unceasing grief,     ha     I feel
sure     ha     here before me were assembled     hose, in whose unhealing
hear    s     he sigh     of     hose bleak     able    s sympa    he    ically caused     he
old wounds     o bleed afresh.

The Pulpi    


I had no     been sea    ed very long ere a man of a cer    ain venerable
robus    ness en    ered; immedia    ely as     he s    orm-pel    ed door flew back
upon admi        ing him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all     he
congrega    ion, sufficien    ly a        es    ed     ha         his fine old man was     he
chaplain. Yes, i     was     he famous Fa    her Mapple, so called by     he
whalemen, among whom he was a very grea     favori    e. He had been a
sailor and a harpooneer in his you    h, bu     for many years pas     had
dedica    ed his life     o     he minis    ry. A         he     ime I now wri    e of,
Fa    her Mapple was in     he hardy win    er of a heal    hy old age;     ha     sor    
of old age which seems merging in    o a second flowering you    h, for
among all     he fissures of his wrinkles,     here shone cer    ain mild
gleams of a newly developing bloom-     he spring verdure peeping for    h
even benea    h February's snow. No one having previously heard his
his    ory, could for     he firs         ime behold Fa    her Mapple wi    hou         he
u    mos     in    eres    , because     here were cer    ain engraf    ed clerical
peculiari    ies abou     him, impu    able     o     ha     adven    urous mari    ime life
he had led. When he en    ered I observed     ha     he carried no umbrella,
and cer    ainly had no     come in his carriage, for his     arpaulin ha     ran
down wi    h mel    ing slee    , and his grea     pilo     clo    h jacke     seemed
almos         o drag him     o     he floor wi    h     he weigh     of     he wa    er i     had
absorbed. However, ha     and coa     and overshoes were one by one
removed, and hung up in a li        le space in an adjacen     corner; when,
arrayed in a decen     sui    , he quie    ly approached     he pulpi    .

Like mos     old fashioned pulpi    s, i     was a very lof    y one, and since a
regular s    airs     o such a heigh     would, by i    s long angle wi    h     he
floor, seriously con    rac         he already small area of     he chapel,     he
archi    ec    , i     seemed, had ac    ed upon     he hin     of Fa    her Mapple, and
finished     he pulpi     wi    hou     a s    airs, subs    i    u    ing a perpendicular
side ladder, like     hose used in moun    ing a ship from a boa     a    
sea. The wife of a whaling cap    ain had provided     he chapel wi    h a
handsome pair of red wors    ed man-ropes for     his ladder, which, being
i    self nicely headed, and s    ained wi    h a mahogany color,     he whole
con    rivance, considering wha     manner of chapel i     was, seemed by no
means in bad     as    e.  Hal    ing for an ins    an     a         he foo     of     he
ladder, and wi    h bo    h hands grasping     he ornamen    al knobs of     he
man-ropes, Fa    her Mapple cas     a look upwards, and     hen wi    h a     ruly
sailor-like bu     s    ill reveren    ial dex    eri    y, hand over hand, moun    ed
    he s    eps as if ascending     he main-    op of his vessel.

The perpendicular par    s of     his side ladder, as is usually     he case
wi    h swinging ones, were of clo    h-covered rope, only     he rounds were
of wood, so     ha     a     every s    ep     here was a join    . A     my firs     glimpse
of     he pulpi    , i     had no     escaped me     ha     however convenien     for a
ship,     hese join    s in     he presen     ins    ance seemed unnecessary. For I
was no     prepared     o see Fa    her Mapple af    er gaining     he heigh    ,
slowly     urn round, and s    ooping over     he pulpi    , delibera    ely drag up
    he ladder s    ep by s    ep,     ill     he whole was deposi    ed wi    hin, leaving
him impregnable in his li        le Quebec.

I pondered some     ime wi    hou     fully comprehending     he reason for
    his. Fa    her Mapple enjoyed such a wide repu    a    ion for sinceri    y and
sanc    i    y,     ha     I could no     suspec     him of cour    ing no    orie    y by any
mere     ricks of     he s    age. No,     hough     I,     here mus     be some sober
reason for     his     hing; fur    hermore, i     mus     symbolize some    hing
unseen. Can i     be,     hen,     ha     by     ha     ac     of physical isola    ion, he
signifies his spiri    ual wi    hdrawal for     he     ime, from all ou    ward
worldly     ies and connexions? Yes, for replenished wi    h     he mea     and
wine of     he word,     o     he fai    hful man of God,     his pulpi    , I see, is
a self-con    aining s    ronghold- a lof    y Ehrenbrei    s    ein, wi    h a
perennial well of wa    er wi    hin     he walls.

Bu         he side ladder was no         he only s    range fea    ure of     he place,
borrowed from     he chaplain's former sea-farings. Be    ween     he marble
ceno    aphs on ei    her hand of     he pulpi    ,     he wall which formed i    s
back was adorned wi    h a large pain    ing represen    ing a gallan     ship
bea    ing agains     a     errible s    orm off a lee coas     of black rocks and
snowy breakers.  Bu     high above     he flying scud and dark-rolling
clouds,     here floa    ed a li        le isle of sunligh    , from which beamed
for    h an angel's face; and     his brigh     face shed a dis    an     spo     of
radiance upon     he ship's     ossed deck, some    hing like     ha     silver
pla    e now inser    ed in    o Vic    ory's plank where Nelson fell. "Ah, noble
ship,"     he angel seemed     o say, "bea     on, bea     on,     hou noble ship,
and bear a hardy helm; for lo!     he sun is breaking     hrough;     he
clouds are rolling off- serenes     azure is a     hand."

Nor was     he pulpi     i    self wi    hou     a     race of     he same sea-    as    e     ha    
had achieved     he ladder and     he pic    ure. I    s panelled fron     was in
    he likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and     he Holy Bible res    ed on a
projec    ing piece of scroll work, fashioned af    er a ship's
fiddle-headed beak.

Wha     could be more full of meaning?- for     he pulpi     is ever     his
ear    h's foremos     par    ; all     he res     comes in i    s rear;     he pulpi    
leads     he world. From     hence i     is     he s    orm of God's quick wra    h is
firs     descried, and     he bow mus     bear     he earlies     brun    . From     hence
i     is     he God of breezes fair or foul is firs     invoked for favorable
winds. Yes,     he world's a ship on i    s passage ou    , and no     a voyage
comple    e; and     he pulpi     is i    s prow.




The Sermon


Fa    her Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming au    hori    y
ordered     he sca        ered people     o condense. "S    ar board gangway,     here!
side away     o larboard- larboard gangway     o s    arboard! Midships!
midships!"

There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boo    s among     he benches, and a
s    ill sligh    er shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quie     again,
and every eye on     he preacher.

He paused a li        le;     hen kneeling in     he pulpi    's bows, folded his
large brown hands across his ches    , uplif    ed his closed eyes, and
offered a prayer so deeply devou         ha     he seemed kneeling and praying
a         he bo        om of     he sea.

This ended, in prolonged solemn     ones, like     he con    inual     olling of
a bell in a ship     ha     is foundering a     sea in a fog- in such     ones he
commenced reading     he following hymn; bu     changing his manner     owards
    he concluding s    anzas, burs     for    h wi    h a pealing exul    a    ion and
joy-

                 The ribs and     errors in     he whale,
                   Arched over me a dismal gloom,
                                  
              While all God's sun-li     waves rolled by,
                 And lif     me deepening down     o doom.
                                  
                   I saw     he opening maw of hell,
                Wi    h endless pains and sorrows     here;
                                  
               Which none bu         hey     ha     feel can     ell-
                   Oh, I was plunging     o despair.
                                  
                 In black dis    ress, I called my God,
                When I could scarce believe him mine,
                                  
                 He bowed his ear     o my complain    s-
                  No more     he whale did me confine.
                                  
                  Wi    h speed he flew     o my relief,
                   As on a radian     dolphin borne;
                                  
                Awful, ye     brigh    , as ligh    ning shone
                    The face of my Deliverer God.
                                  
                    My song for ever shall record
                  Tha         errible,     ha     joyful hour;

                    His all     he mercy and     he pow

Nearly all joined in singing     his hymn, which swelled high above     he
howling of     he s    orm. A brief pause ensued;     he preacher slowly
    urned over     he leaves of     he Bible, and a     las    , folding his hand
down upon     he proper page, said: "Beloved shipma    es, clinch     he las    
verse of     he firs     chap    er of Jonah- 'And God had prepared a grea    
fish     o swallow up Jonah.'"

"Shipma    es,     his book, con    aining only four chap    ers- four yarns- is
one of     he smalles     s    rands in     he migh    y cable of     he
Scrip    ures. Ye     wha     dep    hs of     he soul Jonah's deep sealine sound!
wha     a pregnan     lesson     o us is     his prophe    ! Wha     a noble     hing is
    ha     can    icle in     he fish's belly! How billow-like and bois    erously
grand! We feel     he floods surging over us, we sound wi    h him     o     he
kelpy bo        om of     he wa    ers; sea-weed and all     he slime of     he sea is
abou     us! Bu     wha     is     his lesson     ha         he book of Jonah     eaches?
Shipma    es, i     is a     wo-s    randed lesson; a lesson     o us all as sinful
men, and a lesson     o me as a pilo     of     he living God. As sinful men,
i     is a lesson     o us all, because i     is a s    ory of     he sin,
hard-hear    edness, suddenly awakened fears,     he swif     punishmen    ,
repen    ance, prayers, and finally     he deliverance and joy of Jonah. As
wi    h all sinners among men,     he sin of     his son of Ami        ai was in his
wilful disobedience of     he command of God- never mind now wha         ha    
command was, or how conveyed- which he found a hard command. Bu     all
    he     hings     ha     God would have us do are hard for us     o do- remember
    ha    - and hence, he of    ener commands us     han endeavors     o
persuade. And if we obey God, we mus     disobey ourselves; and i     is in
    his disobeying ourselves, wherein     he hardness of obeying God
consis    s.

"Wi    h     his sin of disobedience in him, Jonah s    ill fur    her flou    s a    
God, by seeking     o flee from Him. He     hinks     ha     a ship made by men,
will carry him in    o coun    ries where God does no     reign bu     only     he
Cap    ains of     his ear    h. He skulks abou         he wharves of Joppa, and
seeks a ship     ha    's bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a
hi    her    o unheeded meaning here. By all accoun    s Tarshish could have
been no o    her ci    y     han     he modern Cadiz. Tha    's     he opinion of
learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipma    es? Cadiz is in Spain; as far
by wa    er, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in     hose
ancien     days, when     he A    lan    ic was an almos     unknown sea. Because
Joppa,     he modern Jaffa, shipma    es, is on     he mos     eas    erly coas     of

worldwide from God? Miserable man! Oh! mos     con    emp    ible and wor    hy
of all scorn; wi    h slouched ha     and guil    y eye, skulking from his
God; prowling among     he shipping like a vile burglar has    ening     o
cross     he seas. So disordered, self-condemning in his look,     ha     had
    here been policemen in     hose days, Jonah, on     he mere suspicion of
some    hing wrong, had been arres    ed ere he     ouched a deck. How plainly
he's a fugi    ive! no baggage, no     a ha    -box, valise, or carpe    -bag,-
no friends accompany him     o     he wharf wi    h     heir adieux. A     las    ,
af    er much dodging search, he finds     he Tarshish ship receiving     he

mark him; he's a bigamis    ;" or, "Harry lad, I guess he's     he

looks from Jonah     o     he bill; while all his sympa    he    ic shipma    es now

Jonah     rembles. and summoning all his boldness     o his face, only
looks so much     he more a coward. He will no     confess himself
suspec    ed; bu         ha     i    self is s    rong suspicion. So he makes     he bes    
of i    ; and when     he sailors find him no         o be     he man     ha     is
adver    ised,     hey le     him pass, and he descends in    o     he cabin.

"'Who's     here?' cries     he Cap    ain a     his busy desk, hurriedly making
ou     his papers for     he Cus    oms- 'Who's     here?' Oh! how     ha     harmless
ques    ion mangles Jonah! For     he ins    an     he almos         urns     o flee
again. Bu     he rallies. 'I seek a passage in     his ship     o Tarshish;
how soon sail ye, sir?' Thus far     he busy Cap    ain had no     looked up
    o Jonah,     hough     he man now s    ands before him; bu     no sooner does he
hear     ha     hollow voice,     han he dar    s a scru    inizing glance. 'We sail
wi    h     he nex     coming     ide,' a     las     he slowly answered, s    ill
in    en    ly eyeing him. 'No sooner, sir?'- 'Soon enough for any hones    
man     ha     goes a passenger.' Ha! Jonah,     ha    's ano    her s    ab. Bu     he
swif    ly calls away     he Cap    ain from     ha     scen    . 'I'll sail wi    h ye,'-
he says,- '    he passage money how much is     ha    ?- I'll pay now.' For i    
is par    icularly wri        en, shipma    es, as if i     were a     hing no         o be
overlooked in     his his    ory, '    ha     he paid     he fare     hereof' ere     he
craf     did sail.  And     aken wi    h     he con    ex    ,     his is full of meaning.

"Now Jonah's Cap    ain, shipma    es, was one whose discernmen     de    ec    s
crime in any, bu     whose cupidi    y exposes i     only in     he penniless. In
    his world, shipma    es, sin     ha     pays i    s way can     ravel freely and
wi    hou     a passpor    ; whereas Vir    ue, if a pauper, is s    opped a     all
fron    iers. So Jonah's Cap    ain prepares     o     es         he leng    h of Jonah's
purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him     hrice     he usual sum;
and i    's assen    ed     o. Then     he Cap    ain knows     ha     Jonah is a
fugi    ive; bu     a         he same     ime resolves     o help a fligh         ha     paves
i    s rear wi    h gold. Ye     when Jonah fairly     akes ou     his purse,
pruden     suspicions s    ill moles         he Cap    ain. He rings every coin     o
find a coun    erfei    . No     a forger, any way, he mu        ers; and Jonah is
pu     down for his passage. 'Poin     ou     my s    a    e-room, Sir,' says Jonah
now, 'I'm     ravel-weary; I need sleep.' 'Thou lookes     like i    ,' says
    he Cap    ain, '    here's     hy room.' Jonah en    ers, and would lock     he
door, bu         he lock con    ains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling
    here,     he Cap    ain laughs lowly     o himself, and mu        ers some    hing
abou         he doors of convic    s' cells being never allowed     o be locked
wi    hin. All dressed and dus    y as he is, Jonah     hrows himself in    o his
ber    h, and finds     he li        le s    a    e-room ceiling almos     res    ing on his
forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in     ha     con    rac    ed
hole, sunk,     oo, benea    h     he ship's wa    er-line, Jonah feels     he
heralding presen    imen     of     ha     s    ifling hour, when     he whale shall
hold him in     he smalles     of his bowels' wards.

"Screwed a     i    s axis agains         he side, a swinging lamp sligh    ly
oscilla    es in Jonah's room; and     he ship, heeling over     owards     he
wharf wi    h     he weigh     of     he las     bales received,     he lamp, flame and
all,     hough in sligh     mo    ion, s    ill main    ains a permanen     obliqui    y
wi    h reference     o     he room;     hough, in     ru    h, infallibly s    raigh    
i    self, i     bu     made obvious     he false, lying levels among which i    
hung. The lamp alarms and frigh    ens Jonah; as lying in his ber    h his
    ormen    ed eyes roll round     he place, and     his     hus far successful
fugi    ive finds no refuge for his res    less glance. Bu         ha    
con    radic    ion in     he lamp more and more appals him. The floor,     he
ceiling, and     he side, are all awry. 'Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!' he groans, 's    raigh     upwards, so i     burns; bu         he chambers of
my soul are all in crookedness!'

"Like one who af    er a nigh     of drunken revelry hies     o his bed, s    ill
reeling, bu     wi    h conscience ye     pricking him, as     he plungings of
    he Roman race-horse bu     so much     he more s    rike his s    eel     ags in    o
him; as one who in     ha     miserable pligh     s    ill     urns and     urns in
giddy anguish, praying God for annihila    ion un    il     he fi     be passed;
and a     las     amid     he whirl of woe he feels, a deep s    upor s    eals over
him, as over     he man who bleeds     o dea    h, for conscience is     he
wound, and     here's naugh         o s    aunch i    ; so, af    er sore wres    ling in
his ber    h, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning
down     o sleep.

"And now     he     ime of     ide has come;     he ship cas    s off her cables;
and from     he deser    ed wharf     he uncheered ship for Tarshish, all
careening, glides     o sea. Tha     ship, my friends, was     he firs     of
recorded smugglers!     he con    raband was Jonah. Bu         he sea rebels; he
will no     bare     he wicked burden. A dreadful s    orm comes on,     he ship
is like     o break. Bu     now when     he boa    swain calls all hands     o
ligh    en her; when boxes, bales, and jars are cla        ering overboard;
when     he wind is shrieking, and     he men are yelling, and every plank
    hunders wi    h     rampling fee     righ     over Jonah's head; in all     his
raging     umul    , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky
and raging sea, feels no         he reeling     imbers, and li        le hears he or
heeds he     he far rush of     he migh    y whale, which even now wi    h open
mou    h is cleaving     he seas af    er him. Aye, shipma    es, Jonah was gone
down in    o     he sides of     he ship- a ber    h in     he cabin as I have     aken
i    , and was fas     asleep. Bu         he frigh    ened mas    er comes     o him, and
shrieks in his dead ear, 'Wha     meanes         hou, O, sleeper! arise!'
S    ar    led from his le    hargy by     ha     direful cry, Jonah s    aggers     o his
fee    , and s    umbling     o     he deck, grasps a shroud,     o look ou     upon
    he sea. Bu     a         ha     momen     he is sprung upon by a pan    her billow
leaping over     he bulwarks. Wave af    er wave     hus leaps in    o     he ship,
and finding no speedy ven     runs roaring fore and af    ,     ill     he
mariners come nigh     o drowning while ye     afloa    . And ever, as     he
whi    e moon shows her affrigh    ed face from     he s    eep gullies in     he
blackness overhead, aghas     Jonah sees     he rearing bowspri     poin    ing
high upward, bu     soon bea     downward again     owards     he     ormen    ed deep.

"Terrors upon     errors run shou    ing     hrough his soul. In all his
cringing a        i    udes,     he God-fugi    ive is now     oo plainly known. The
sailors mark him; more and more cer    ain grow     heir suspicions of him,
and a     las    , fully     o     es         he     ru    h, by referring     he whole ma        er

cause     his grea         empes     was upon     hem. The lo     is Jonah's;     ha    
discovered,     hen how furiously     hey mob him wi    h     heir
ques    ions. 'Wha     is     hine occupa    ion? Whence comes         hou? Thy
coun    ry? Wha     people? Bu     mark now, my shipma    es,     he behavior of
poor Jonah. The eager mariners bu     ask him who he is, and where from;
whereas,     hey no     only receive an answer     o     hose ques    ions, bu    
likewise ano    her answer     o a ques    ion no     pu     by     hem, bu         he
unsolici    ed answer is forced from Jonah by     he hard hand of God     ha    
is upon him.

"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries- and     hen- 'I fear     he Lord     he God of
Heaven who ha    h made     he sea and     he dry land!' Fear him, O Jonah?
Aye, well migh    es         hou fear     he Lord God     hen! S    raigh    way, he now
goes on     o make a full confession; whereupon     he mariners became more
and more appalled, bu     s    ill are pi    iful. For when Jonah, no     ye    
supplica    ing God for mercy, since he bu         oo well knew     he darkness
of his deser    s,- when wre    ched Jonah cries ou         o     hem     o     ake him
and cas     him for    h in    o     he sea, for he knew     ha     for his sake     his
grea         empes     was upon     hem;     hey mercifully     urn from him, and seek
by o    her means     o save     he ship. Bu     all in vain;     he indignan     gale
howls louder;     hen, wi    h one hand raised invokingly     o God, wi    h     he
o    her     hey no     unreluc    an    ly lay hold of Jonah.

"And now behold Jonah     aken up as an anchor and dropped in    o     he sea;
when ins    an    ly an oily calmness floa    s ou     from     he eas    , and     he sea
is as Jonah carries down     he gale wi    h him, leaving smoo    h wa    er
behind. He goes down in     he whirling hear     of such a mas    erless
commo    ion     ha     he scarce heeds     he momen     when he drops see    hing in    o
    he yawning jaws awai    ing him; and     he whale shoo    s-    o all his ivory
    ee    h, like so many whi    e bol    s, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed
un    o     he Lord ou     of     he fish's belly. Bu     observe his prayer, and
learn a weigh    y lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does no     weep and
wail for direc     deliverance. He feels     ha     his dreadful punishmen     is
jus    . He leaves all his deliverance     o God, con    en    ing himself wi    h
    his,     ha     spi    e of all his pains and pangs, he will s    ill look
    owards His holy     emple. And here, shipma    es, is     rue and fai    hful
repen    ance; no     clamorous for pardon, bu     gra    eful for
punishmen    . And how pleasing     o God was     his conduc     in Jonah, is
shown in     he even    ual deliverance of him from     he sea and     he
whale. Shipma    es, I do no     place Jonah before you     o be copied for
his sin bu     I do place him before you as a model for repen    ance. Sin
no    ; bu     if you do,     ake heed     o repen     of i     like Jonah."

While he was speaking     hese words,     he howling of     he shrieking,
slan    ing s    orm wi    hou     seemed     o add new power     o     he preacher, who,
when describing Jonah's sea-s    orm, seemed     ossed by a s    orm
himself. His deep ches     heaved as wi    h a ground-swell; his     ossed
arms seemed     he warring elemen    s a     work; and     he     hunders     ha    
rolled away from off his swar    hy brow, and     he ligh     leaping from his
eye, made all his simple hearers look on him wi    h a quick fear     ha    
was s    range     o     hem.

There now came a lull in his look, as he silen    ly     urned over     he
leaves of     he Book once more; and, a     las    , s    anding mo    ionless, wi    h
closed eyes, for     he momen    , seemed communing wi    h God and himself.

Bu     again he leaned over     owards     he people, and bowing his head
lowly, wi    h an aspec     of     he deepes     ye     manlies     humili    y, he spake
    hese words:

"Shipma    es, God has laid bu     one hand upon you; bo    h his hands press
upon me. I have read ye by wha     murky ligh     may be mine     he lesson
    ha     Jonah     eaches     o all sinners; and     herefore     o ye, and s    ill
more     o me, for I am a grea    er sinner     han ye. And now how gladly
would I come down from     his mas    -head and si     on     he ha    ches     here
where you si    , and lis    en as you lis    en, while some one of you reads
me     ha     o    her and more awful lesson which Jonah     eaches     o me, as a
pilo     of     he living God. How being an anoin    ed pilo    -prophe    , or
speaker of     rue     hings and bidden by     he Lord     o sound     hose
unwelcome     ru    hs in     he ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled a    
    he hos    ili    y he should raise, fled from his mission, and sough         o
escape his du    y and his God by     aking ship a     Joppa.  Bu     God is
everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon
him in     he whale, and swallowed him down     o living gulfs of doom, and
wi    h swif     slan    ings     ore him along 'in    o     he mids     of     he seas,'
where     he eddying dep    hs sucked him     en     housand fa    homs down, and
'    he weeds were wrapped abou     his head,' and all     he wa    ery world of
woe bowled over him. Ye     even     hen beyond     he reach of any plumme    -
'ou     of     he belly of hell'- when     he whale grounded upon     he ocean's
u    mos     bones, even     hen, God heard     he engulphed, repen    ing prophe    
when he cried. Then God spake un    o     he fish; and from     he shuddering
cold and blackness of     he sea,     he whale came breeching up     owards
    he warm and pleasan     sun, and all     he deligh    s of air and ear    h; and
'vomi    ed ou     Jonah upon     he dry land;' when     he word of     he Lord came
a second     ime; and Jonah, bruised and bea    en- his ears, like     wo
sea-shells, s    ill mul    i    udinously murmuring of     he ocean- Jonah did
    he Almigh    y's bidding. And wha     was     ha    , shipma    es? To preach     he
Tru    h     o     he face of Falsehood! Tha     was i    !

"This, shipma    es,     his is     ha     o    her lesson; and woe     o     ha     pilo     of

Yea, woe     o him who as     he grea     Pilo     Paul has i    , while preaching
    o o    hers is himself a cas    away!

He drooped and fell away from himself for a momen    ;     hen lif    ing his
face     o     hem again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried ou    
wi    h a heavenly en    husiasm,- "Bu     oh! shipma    es! on     he s    arboard

He said no more, bu     slowly waving a benedic    ion, covered his face
wi    h his hands, and so remained kneeling,     ill all     he people had

A Bosom Friend


Re    urning     o     he Spou    er-Inn from     he Chapel, I found Queequeg     here
qui    e alone; he having lef         he Chapel before     he benedic    ion some

jack-knife gen    ly whi        ling away a     i    s nose, meanwhile humming     o

Bu     being now in    errup    ed, he pu     up     he image; and pre        y soon,

as    onishmen    . He would     hen begin again a         he nex     fif    y; seeming     o
commence a     number one each     ime, as     hough he could no     coun     more
    han fif    y, and i     was only by such a large number of fif    ies being
found     oge    her,     ha     his as    onishmen     a         he mul    i    ude of pages was
exci    ed.

Wi    h much in    eres     I sa     wa    ching him. Savage     hough he was, and
hideously marred abou         he face- a     leas         o my     as    e- his
coun    enance ye     had a some    hing in i     which was by no means
disagreeable. You canno     hide     he soul. Through all his unear    hly
    a        ooings, I     hough     I saw     he     races of a simple hones     hear    ; and
in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold,     here seemed     okens of
a spiri         ha     would dare a     housand devils. And besides all     his,
    here was a cer    ain lof    y bearing abou         he Pagan, which even his
uncou    hness could no     al    oge    her maim. He looked like a man who had
never cringed and never had had a credi    or. Whe    her i     was,     oo,     ha    
his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn ou     in freer and
brigh    er relief, and looked more expansive     han i     o    herwise would,
    his I will no     ven    ure     o decide; bu     cer    ain i     was his head was
phrenologically an excellen     one. I     may seem ridiculous, bu     i    
reminded me of General Washing    on's head, as seen in     he popular
bus    s of him. I     had     he same long regularly graded re    rea    ing slope
from above     he brows, which were likewise very projec    ing, like     wo
long promon    ories     hickly wooded on     op. Queequeg was George
Washing    on cannibalis    ically developed.

Whils     I was     hus closely scanning him, half-pre    ending meanwhile     o
be looking ou     a         he s    orm from     he casemen    , he never heeded my
presence, never     roubled himself wi    h so much as a single glance; bu    
appeared wholly occupied wi    h coun    ing     he pages of     he marvellous
book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping     oge    her     he
nigh     previous, and especially considering     he affec    iona    e arm I had
found     hrown over me upon waking in     he morning, I     hough         his
indifference of his very s    range. Bu     savages are s    range beings; a    
    imes you do no     know exac    ly how     o     ake     hem. A     firs         hey are
overawing;     heir calm self-collec    edness of simplici    y seems as
Socra    ic wisdom. I had no    iced also     ha     Queequeg never consor    ed a    
all, or bu     very li        le, wi    h     he o    her seamen in     he inn. He made no
advances wha    ever; appeared     o have no desire     o enlarge     he circle
of his acquain    ances. All     his s    ruck me as migh    y singular; ye    ,
upon second     hough    s,     here was some    hing almos     sublime in i    . Here
was a man some     wen    y     housand miles from home, by     he way of Cape
Horn,     ha     is- which was     he only way he could ge         here-     hrown
among people as s    range     o him as     hough he were in     he plane    
Jupi    er; and ye     he seemed en    irely a     his ease; preserving     he
u    mos     sereni    y; con    en     wi    h his own companionship; always equal     o
himself. Surely     his was a     ouch of fine philosophy;     hough no doub    
he had never heard     here was such a     hing as     ha    . Bu    , perhaps,     o
be     rue philosophers, we mor    als should no     be conscious of so living
or so s    riving. So soon as I hear     ha     such or such a man gives
himself ou     for a philosopher, I conclude     ha    , like     he dyspep    ic
old woman, he mus     have "broken his diges    er."

As I sa         here in     ha     now lonely room;     he fire burning low, in     ha    
mild s    age when, af    er i    s firs     in    ensi    y has warmed     he air, i    
    hen only glows     o be looked a    ;     he evening shades and phan    oms
ga    hering round     he casemen    s, and peering in upon us silen    ,
soli    ary     wain;     he s    orm booming wi    hou     in solemn swells; I began
    o be sensible of s    range feelings. I fel     a mel    ing in me. No more
my splin    ered hear     and maddened hand were     urned agains         he wolfish
world. This soo    hing savage had redeemed i    . There he sa    , his very
indifference speaking a na    ure in which     here lurked no civilized
hypocrisies and bland decei    s. he was; a very sigh     of sigh    s     o see;
ye     I began     o feel myself mys    eriously drawn     owards him. And     hose
same     hings     ha     would have repelled mos     o    hers,     hey were     he very
magne    s     ha         hus drew me. I'll     ry a pagan friend,     hough     I, since
Chris    ian kindness has proved bu     hollow cour    esy. I drew my bench
near him, and made some friendly signs and hin    s, doing my bes         o
    alk wi    h him meanwhile. A     firs     he li        le no    iced     hese advances;
bu     presen    ly, upon my referring     o his las     nigh    's hospi    ali    ies,
he made ou         o ask me whe    her we were again     o be bedfellows. I     old
him yes; wherea     I     hough     he looked pleased, perhaps a li        le
complimen    ed.

We     hen     urned over     he book     oge    her, and I endeavored     o explain     o
him     he purpose of     he prin    ing, and     he meaning of     he few pic    ures
    ha     were in i    . Thus I soon engaged his in    eres    ; and from     ha     we
wen         o jabbering     he bes     we could abou         he various ou    er sigh    s     o
be seen in     his famous     own. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
producing his pouch and     omahawk, he quie    ly offered me a puff. And
    hen we sa     exchanging puffs from     ha     wild pipe of his, and keeping
i     regularly passing be    ween us.

If     here ye     lurked any ice of indifference     owards me in     he Pagan's
breas    ,     his pleasan    , genial smoke we had, soon     hawed i     ou    , and
lef     us cronies. He seemed     o     ake     o me qui    e as na    urally and
unbiddenly as I     o him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
forehead agains     mine, clasped me round     he wais    , and said     ha    
hencefor    h we were married; meaning, in his coun    ry's phrase,     ha     we
were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In
a coun    ryman,     his sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far
    oo prema    ure, a     hing     o be much dis    rus    ed; bu     in     his simple
savage     hose old rules would no     apply.

Af    er supper, and ano    her social cha     and smoke, we wen         o our room
    oge    her. He made me a presen     of his embalmed head;     ook ou     his
enormous     obacco walle    , and groping under     he     obacco, drew ou     some
    hir    y dollars in silver;     hen spreading     hem on     he     able, and
mechanically dividing     hem in    o     wo equal por    ions, pushed one of
    hem     owards me, and said i     was mine. I was going     o remons    ra    e;
bu     he silenced me by pouring     hem in    o my     rowsers' pocke    s. I le    
    hem s    ay. He     hen wen     abou     his evening prayers,     ook ou     his idol,
and removed     he paper firebrand. By cer    ain signs and symp    oms, I
    hough     he seemed anxious for me     o join him; bu     well knowing wha    
was     o follow, I delibera    ed a momen     whe    her, in case he invi    ed me,
I would comply or o    herwise.

I was a good Chris    ian; born and bred in     he bosom of     he infallible
Presby    erian Church. How     hen could I uni    e wi    h     his wild idola    or
in worshipping his piece of wood?  Bu     wha     is worship?     hough     I. Do
you suppose now, Ishmael,     ha         he magnanimous God of heaven and
ear    h- pagans and all included- can possibly be jealous of an
insignifican     bi     of black wood? Impossible! Bu     wha     is worship?-     o
do     he will of God?     ha     is worship.  And wha     is     he will of God?-
    o do     o my fellow man wha     I would have my fellow man     o do     o me-
    ha     is     he will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And wha     do
I wish     ha         his Queequeg would do     o me? Why, uni    e wi    h me in my
par    icular Presby    erian form of worship. Consequen    ly, I mus         hen
uni    e wi    h him in his; ergo, I mus         urn idola    or. So I kindled     he
shavings; helped prop up     he innocen     li        le idol; offered him burn    
biscui     wi    h Queequeg; salamed before him     wice or     hrice; kissed his
nose; and     ha     done, we undressed and wen         o bed, a     peace wi    h our
own consciences and all     he world. Bu     we did no     go     o sleep wi    hou    
some li        le cha    .

How i     is I know no    ; bu         here is no place like a bed for
confiden    ial disclosures be    ween friends. Man and wife,     hey say,
    here open     he very bo        om of     heir souls     o each o    her; and some old
couples of    en lie and cha     over old     imes     ill nearly morning. Thus,
    hen, in our hear    s' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg- a cosy, loving
pair.




Nigh    gown


We had lain     hus in bed, cha        ing and napping a     shor     in    ervals, and
Queequeg now and     hen affec    iona    ely     hrowing his brown     a        ooed legs
over mine, and     hen drawing     hem back; so en    irely sociable and free
and easy were we; when, a     las    , by reason of our confabula    ions,
wha     li        le nappishness remained in us al    oge    her depar    ed, and we
fel     like ge        ing up again,     hough day-break was ye     some way down
    he fu    ure.

Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so     ha     our recumben     posi    ion
began     o grow wearisome, and by li        le and li        le we found ourselves
si        ing up;     he clo    hes well     ucked around us, leaning agains         he
headboard wi    h our four knees drawn up close     oge    her, and our     wo
noses bending over     hem, as if our knee-pans were warming-pans. We
fel     very nice and snug,     he more so since i     was so chilly ou     of
doors; indeed ou     of bed-clo    hes     oo, seeing     ha         here was no fire
in     he room. The more so, I say, because     ruly     o enjoy bodily
warm    h, some small par     of you mus     be cold, for     here is no quali    y
in     his world     ha     is no     wha     i     is merely by con    ras    . No    hing
exis    s in i    self. If you fla        er yourself     ha     you are all over
comfor    able, and have been so a long     ime,     hen you canno     be said     o
be comfor    able any more. Bu     if, like Queequeg and me in     he bed,     he
    ip of your nose or     he crown of your head be sligh    ly chilled, why
    hen, indeed, in     he general consciousness you feel mos     deligh    fully
and unmis    akably warm. For     his reason a sleeping apar    men     should
never be furnished wi    h a fire, which is one of     he luxurious
discomfor    s of     he rich. For     he heigh     of     his sor     of deliciousness
is     o have no    hing bu         he blanke    s be    ween you and your snugness and
    he cold of     he ou    er air. Then     here you lie like     he one warm spark
in     he hear     of an arc    ic crys    al.

We had been si        ing in     his crouching manner for some     ime, when all
a     once I     hough     I would open my eyes; for when be    ween shee    s,
whe    her by day or by nigh    , and whe    her asleep or awake, I have a way
of always keeping my eyes shu    , in order     he more     o concen    ra    e     he
snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own
iden    i    y arigh     excep     his eyes be closed; as if, darkness were
indeed     he proper elemen     of our essences,     hough ligh     be more
congenial     o our clayey par    . Upon opening my eyes     hen, and coming
ou     of my own pleasan     and self-crea    ed darkness in    o     he imposed and
coarse ou    er gloom of     he unillumina    ed     welve-o'clock-a    -nigh    , I
experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I a     all objec         o     he
hin     from Queequeg     ha     perhaps i     were bes         o s    rike a ligh    ,
seeing     ha     we were so wide awake; and besides he fel     a s    rong
desire     o have a few quie     puffs from his Tomahawk. Be i     said,     ha    
    hough I had fel     such a s    rong repugnance     o his smoking in     he bed
    he nigh     before, ye     see how elas    ic our s    iff prejudices grow when
once love comes     o bend     hem. For now I liked no    hing be        er     han     o
have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed     o be
full of such serene household joy     hen. I no more fel     unduly
concerned for     he landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive     o
    he condensed confiden    ial comfor    ableness of sharing a pipe and a
blanke     wi    h a real friend. Wi    h our shaggy jacke    s drawn abou     our
shoulders, we now passed     he Tomahawk from one     o     he o    her,     ill
slowly     here grew over us a blue hanging     es    er of smoke, illumina    ed
by     he flame of     he new-li     lamp.

Whe    her i     was     ha         his undula    ing     es    er rolled     he savage away     o
far dis    an     scenes, I know no    , bu     he now spoke of his na    ive
island; and, eager     o hear his his    ory, I begged him     o go on and
    ell i    . He gladly complied. Though a         he     ime I bu     ill
comprehended no     a few of his words, ye     subsequen     disclosures, when
I had become more familiar wi    h his broken phraseology, now enable me
    o presen         he whole s    ory such as i     may prove in     he mere skele    on
I give.




Biographical


Queequeg was a na    ive of Rokovoko, an island far away     o     he Wes     and
Sou    h. I     is no     down on any map;     rue places never are.

When a new-ha    ched savage running wild abou     his na    ive woodlands in
a grass clou    , followed by     he nibbling goa    s, as if he were a green
sapling; even     hen, in Queequeg's ambi    ious soul, lurked a s    rong
desire     o see some    hing more of Chris    endom     han a specimen whaler or
    wo. His fa    her was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Pries    ;
and on     he ma    ernal side he boas    ed aun    s who were     he wives of
unconquerable warriors. There was excellen     blood in his veins- royal
s    uff;     hough sadly vi    ia    ed, I fear, by     he cannibal propensi    y he
nourished in his un    u    ored you    h.

A Sag Harbor ship visi    ed his fa    her's bay, and Queequeg sough     a
passage     o Chris    ian lands. Bu         he ship, having her full complemen    
of seamen, spurned his sui    ; and no     all     he King his fa    her's
influence could prevail. Bu     Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his
canoe, he paddled off     o a dis    an     s    rai    , which he knew     he ship
mus     pass     hrough when she qui        ed     he island. On one side was a
coral reef; on     he o    her a low     ongue of land, covered wi    h mangrove
    hicke    s     ha     grew ou     in    o     he wa    er. Hiding his canoe, s    ill
afloa    , among     hese     hicke    s, wi    h i    s prow seaward, he sa     down in
    he s    ern, paddle low in hand; and when     he ship was gliding by, like
a flash he dar    ed ou    ; gained her side; wi    h one backward dash of his
foo     capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up     he chains; and     hrowing
himself a     full leng    h upon     he deck, grappled a ring-bol         here, and
swore no         o le     i     go,     hough hacked in pieces.

In vain     he cap    ain     hrea    ened     o     hrow him overboard; suspended a
cu    lass over his naked wris    s; Queequeg was     he son of a King, and
Queequeg budged no    . S    ruck by his despera    e daun    lessness, and his
wild desire     o visi     Chris    endom,     he cap    ain a     las     relen    ed, and
    old him he migh     make himself a     home. Bu         his fine young savage-
    his sea Prince of Wales, never saw     he Cap    ain's cabin. They pu     him
down among     he sailors, and made a whaleman of him. Bu     like Czar
Pe    er con    en         o     oil in     he shipyards of foreign ci    ies, Queequeg
disdained no seeming ignominy, if     hereby he migh     happily gain     he
power of enligh    ening his un    u    ored coun    rymen. For a     bo        om- so he
    old me- he was ac    ua    ed by a profound desire     o learn among     he
Chris    ians,     he ar    s whereby     o make his people s    ill happier     han
    hey were; and more     han     ha    , s    ill be        er     han     hey were. Bu    ,
alas!     he prac    ices of whalemen soon convinced him     ha     even
Chris    ians could be bo    h miserable and wicked; infini    ely more so,
    han all his fa    her's hea    hens. Arrived a     las     in old Sag Harbor;
and seeing wha         he sailors did     here; and     hen going on     o
Nan    ucke    , and seeing how     hey spen         heir wages in     ha     place also,
poor Queequeg gave i     up for los    . Though     he, i    's a wicked world in
all meridians; I'll die a pagan.

And     hus an old idola    or a     hear    , he ye     lived among     hese
Chris    ians, wore     heir clo    hes, and     ried     o     alk     heir
gibberish. Hence     he queer ways abou     him,     hough now some     ime from
home.

By hin    s I asked him whe    her he did no     propose going back, and
having a corona    ion; since he migh     now consider his fa    her dead and
gone, he being very old and feeble a         he las     accoun    s. He answered
no, no     ye    ; and added     ha     he was fearful Chris    iani    y, or ra    her
Chris    ians, had unfi        ed him for ascending     he pure and undefiled
    hrone of     hir    y pagan Kings before him. Bu     by and by, he said, he
would re    urn,- as soon as he fel     himself bap    ized again. For     he
nonce, however, he proposed     o sail abou    , and sow his wild oa    s in
all four oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and     ha     barbed
iron was in lieu of a scep    re now.

I asked him wha     migh     be his immedia    e purpose,     ouching his fu    ure
movemen    s. He answered,     o go     o sea again, in his old voca    ion. Upon
    his, I     old him     ha     whaling was my own design, and informed him of
my in    en    ion     o sail ou     of Nan    ucke    , as being     he mos     promising
por     for an adven    urous whaleman     o embark from. He a     once resolved
    o accompany me     o     ha     island, ship aboard     he same vessel, ge     in    o
    he same wa    ch,     he same boa    ,     he same mess wi    h me, in shor         o
share my every hap; wi    h bo    h my hands in his, boldly dip in    o     he
Po    luck of bo    h worlds. To all     his I joyously assen    ed; for besides
    he affec    ion I now fel     for Queequeg, he was an experienced
harpooneer, and as such, could no     fail     o be of grea     usefulness     o
one, who, like me, was wholly ignoran     of     he mys    eries of whaling,
    hough well acquain    ed wi    h     he sea, as known     o merchan     seamen.

His s    ory being ended wi    h his pipe's las     dying puff, Queequeg
embraced me, pressed his forehead agains     mine, and blowing ou         he
ligh    , we rolled over from each o    her,     his way and     ha    , and very
soon were sleeping.




Wheelbarrow


Nex     morning, Monday, af    er disposing of     he embalmed head     o a
barber, for a block, I se        led my own and comrade's bill; using,
however, my comrade's money. The grinning landlord, as well as     he
boarders, seemed amazingly     ickled a         he sudden friendship which had
sprung up be    ween me and Queequeg- especially as Pe    er Coffin's cock
and bull s    ories abou     him had previously so much alarmed me
concerning     he very person whom I now companied wi    h.

We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our     hings, including my own
poor carpe    -bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we wen    
down     o "    he Moss,"     he li        le Nan    ucke     packe     schooner moored a    
    he wharf. As we were going along     he people s    ared; no     a     Queequeg
so much- for     hey were used     o seeing cannibals like him in     heir
s    ree    s,- bu     a     seeing him and me upon such confiden    ial     erms. Bu    
we heeded     hem no    , going along wheeling     he barrow by     urns, and
Queequeg now and     hen s    opping     o adjus         he shea    h on his harpoon
barbs. I asked him why he carried such a     roublesome     hing wi    h him
ashore, and whe    her all whaling ships did no     find     heir own
harpoons. To     his, in subs    ance, he replied,     ha         hough wha     I
hin    ed was     rue enough, ye     he had a par    icular affec    ion for his own
harpoon, because i     was of assured s    uff, well     ried in many a mor    al
comba    , and deeply in    ima    e wi    h     he hear    s of whales. In shor    , like
many reapers and mowers, who go in    o     he farmer's meadows armed wi    h
    heir own scy    hes-     hough in no wise obliged     o furnish     hem- even
so, Queequeg, for his own priva    e reasons, preferred his own harpoon.

Shif    ing     he barrow from my hand     o his, he     old me a funny s    ory
abou         he firs     wheelbarrow he had ever seen. I     was in Sag
Harbor. The owners of his ship, i     seems, had len     him one, in which
    o carry his heavy ches         o his boarding house. No         o seem ignoran    
abou         he     hing-     hough in     ru    h he was en    irely so, concerning     he
precise way in which     o manage     he barrow- Queequeg pu    s his ches    
upon i    ; lashes i     fas    ; and     hen shoulders     he barrow and marches up
    he wharf. "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you migh     have known be        er     han
    ha    , one would     hink. Didn'         he people laugh?"

Upon     his, he     old me ano    her s    ory. The people of his island of
Rokovoko, i     seems, a         heir wedding feas    s express     he fragran    
wa    er of young cocoanu    s in    o a large s    ained calabash like a
punchbowl; and     his punchbowl always forms     he grea     cen    ral ornamen    
on     he braided ma     where     he feas     is held. Now a cer    ain grand
merchan     ship once     ouched a     Rokovoko, and i    s commander- from all
accoun    s, a very s    a    ely punc    ilious gen    leman, a     leas     for a sea
cap    ain-     his commander was invi    ed     o     he wedding feas     of
Queequeg's sis    er, a pre        y young princess jus         urned of     en. Well;
when all     he wedding gues    s were assembled a         he bride's bamboo
co        age,     his Cap    ain marches in, and being assigned     he pos     of
honor, placed himself over agains         he punchbowl, and be    ween     he
High Pries     and his majes    y     he King, Queequeg's fa    her. Grace being
said,- for     hose people have     heir grace as well as we-     hough
Queequeg     old me     ha     unlike us, who a     such     imes look downwards     o
our pla        ers,     hey, on     he con    rary, copying     he ducks, glance
upwards     o     he grea     Giver of all feas    s- Grace, I say, being said,
    he High Pries     opens     he banque     by     he immemorial ceremony of     he
island;     ha     is, dipping his consecra    ed and consecra    ing fingers
in    o     he bowl before     he blessed beverage circula    es. Seeing himself
placed nex         he Pries    , and no    ing     he ceremony, and     hinking
himself- being Cap    ain of a ship- as having plain precedence over a
mere island King, especially in     he King's own house-     he Cap    ain
coolly proceeds     o wash his hands in     he punch bowl;-     aking i     I
suppose for a huge finger-glass. "Now," said Queequeg, "wha     you     ink
now?- Didn'     our people laugh?"

A     las    , passage paid, and luggage safe, we s    ood on board     he
schooner. Hois    ing sail, i     glided down     he Acushne     river. On one
side, New Bedford rose in     erraces of s    ree    s,     heir ice-covered
    rees all gli        ering in     he clear, cold air. Huge hills and moun    ains
of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side     he
world-wandering whale ships lay silen     and safely moored a     las    ;
while from o    hers came a sound of carpen    ers and coopers, wi    h
blended noises of fires and forges     o mel         he pi    ch, all be    okening
    ha     new cruises were on     he s    ar    ;     ha     one mos     perilous and long
voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a
    hird, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is     he endlessness,
yea,     he in    olerableness of all ear    hly effor    .

Gaining     he more open wa    er,     he bracing breeze waxed fresh;     he
li        le Moss     ossed     he quick foam from her bows, as a young col     his
snor    ings. How I snuffed     ha     Tar    ar air!- how I spurned     ha    
    urnpike ear    h!-     ha     common highway all over den    ed wi    h     he marks
of slavish heels and hoofs; and     urned me     o admire     he magnanimi    y
of     he sea which will permi     no records.

A         he same foam-foun    ain, Queequeg seemed     o drink and reel wi    h
me. His dusky nos    rils swelled apar    ; he showed his filed and poin    ed
    ee    h. On, on we flew, and our offing gained,     he Moss did homage     o
    he blas    ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before     he
Sul    an. Sideways leaning, we sideways dar    ed; every ropeyarn     ingling
like a wire;     he     wo     all mas    s buckling like Indian canes in land
    ornadoes. So full of     his reeling scene were we, as we s    ood by     he
plunging bowspri    ,     ha     for some     ime we did no     no    ice     he jeering
glances of     he passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled     ha    
    wo fellow beings should be so companionable; as     hough a whi    e man
were any    hing more dignified     han a whi    ewashed negro. Bu         here were
some boobies and bumpkins     here, who, by     heir in    ense greenness,
mus     have come from     he hear     and cen    re of all verdure.  Queequeg
caugh     one of     hese young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I
    hough         he bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon,
    he brawny savage caugh     him in his arms, and by an almos     miraculous
dex    eri    y and s    reng    h, sen     him high up bodily in    o     he air;     hen
sligh    ly     apping his s    ern in mid-somerse    ,     he fellow landed wi    h
burs    ing lungs upon his fee    , while Queequeg,     urning his back upon
him, ligh    ed his     omahawk pipe and passed i         o me for a puff.

"Cap    ing! Cap    ing! yelled     he bumpkin, running     oward     ha     officer;
"Cap    ing, Cap    ing, here's     he devil."

"Hallo, you sir," cried     he Cap    ain, a gaun     rib of     he sea, s    alking
up     o Queequeg, "wha     in     hunder do you mean by     ha    ? Don'     you know
you migh     have killed     ha     chap?"

"Wha     him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly     urned     o me.

"He say," said I, "    ha     you came near kill-e     ha     man     here,"
poin    ing     o     he s    ill shivering greenhorn.

"Kill-e," cried Queequeg,     wis    ing his     a        ooed face in    o an
unear    hly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;
Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"

"Look you," roared     he Cap    ain, "I'll kill-e you, you cannibal, if
you     ry any more of your     ricks aboard here; so mind your eye."

Bu     i     so happened jus         hen,     ha     i     was high     ime for     he Cap    ain
    o mind his own eye. The prodigious s    rain upon     he main-sail had
par    ed     he wea    her-shee    , and     he     remendous boom was now flying from
side     o side, comple    ely sweeping     he en    ire af    er par     of     he
deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swep    
overboard; all hands were in a panic; and     o a        emp     sna    ching a         he
boom     o s    ay i    , seemed madness. I     flew from righ         o lef    , and back
again, almos     in one     icking of a wa    ch, and every ins    an     seemed on
    he poin     of snapping in    o splin    ers. No    hing was done, and no    hing
seemed capable of being done;     hose on deck rushed     oward     he bows,
and s    ood eyeing     he boom as if i     were     he lower jaw of an
exaspera    ed whale. In     he mids     of     his cons    erna    ion, Queequeg
dropped def    ly     o his knees, and crawling under     he pa    h of     he boom,
whipped hold of a rope, secured one end     o     he bulwarks, and     hen
flinging     he o    her like a lasso, caugh     i     round     he boom as i     swep    
over his head, and a         he nex     jerk,     he spar was     ha     way     rapped,
and all was safe. The schooner was run in    o     he wind, and while     he
hands were clearing away     he s    ern boa    , Queequeg, s    ripped     o     he
wais    , dar    ed from     he side wi    h a long living arc of a leap. For
    hree minu    es or more he was seen swimming like a dog,     hrowing his
long arms s    raigh     ou     before him, and by     urns revealing his brawny
shoulders     hrough     he freezing foam. I looked a         he grand and
glorious bu     saw no one     o be saved. The greenhorn had gone
down. Shoo    ing himself perpendicularly from     he wa    er, Queequeg, now
    ook an ins    an    's glance around him, and seeming     o see jus     how
ma        ers were, dived down and disappeared. A few minu    es more, and he
rose again, one arm s    ill s    riking ou    , and wi    h     he o    her dragging a
lifeless form.  The boa     soon picked     hem up. The poor bumpkin was
res    ored. All hands vo    ed Queequeg a noble     rump;     he cap    ain begged
his pardon. From     ha     hour I clove     o Queequeg like a barnacle; yea,
    ill poor Queequeg     ook his las     long dive.

Was     here ever such unconsciousness? He did no     seem     o     hink     ha     he
a     all deserved a medal from     he Humane and Magnanimous Socie    ies. He
only asked for wa    er- fresh wa    er- some    hing     o wipe     he brine off;
    ha     done, he pu     on dry clo    hes, ligh    ed his pipe, and leaning
agains         he bulwarks, and mildly eyeing     hose around him, seemed     o
be saying     o himself- "I    's a mu    ual, join    -s    ock world, in all
meridians. We cannibals mus     help     hese Chris    ians."




Nan    ucke    


No    hing more happened on     he passage wor    hy     he men    ioning; so, af    er
a fine run, we safely arrived in Nan    ucke    .

Nan    ucke    ! Take ou     your map and look a     i    . See wha     a real corner
of     he world i     occupies; how i     s    ands     here, away off shore, more
lonely     han     he Eddys    one ligh    house.  Look a     i    - a mere hillock,

Look now a         he wondrous     radi    ional s    ory of how     his island was
se        led by     he red-men. Thus goes     he legend. In olden     imes an eagle
swooped down upon     he New England coas     and carried off an infan    
Indian in his     alons. Wi    h loud lamen         he paren    s saw     heir child

Wha     wonder,     hen,     ha         hese Nan    ucke    ers, born on a beach, should

Chowder


I     was qui    e la    e in     he evening when     he li        le Moss came snugly     o
anchor, and Queequeg and I wen     ashore; so we could a        end     o no
business     ha     day, a     leas     none bu     a supper and a bed. The landlord
of     he Spou    er-Inn had recommended us     o his cousin Hosea Hussey of
    he Try Po    s, whom he asser    ed     o be     he proprie    or of one of     he
bes     kep     ho    els in all Nan    ucke    , and moreover he had assured us
    ha     Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In
shor    , he plainly hin    ed     ha     we could no     possibly do be        er     han
    ry po    -luck a         he Try Po    s. Bu         he direc    ions hc had given us
abou     keeping a yellow warehouse on our s    arboard hand     ill we opened
a whi    e church     o     he larboard, and     hen keeping     ha     on     he larboard
hand     ill we made a corner     hree poin    s     o     he s    arboard, and     ha    
done,     hen ask     he firs     man we me     where     he place was;     hese
crooked direc    ions of his very much puzzled us a     firs    , especially
as, a         he ou    se    , Queequeg insis    ed     ha         he yellow warehouse- our
firs     poin     of depar    ure- mus     be lef     on     he larboard hand, whereas
I had unders    ood Pe    er Coffin     o say i     was on     he s    arboard.
However, by din     of bea    ing abou     a li        le in     he dark, and now and
    hen knocking up a peaceful inhabi    an         o inquire     he way, we a     las    
came     o some    hing which     here was no mis    aking.

Two enormous wooden po    s pain    ed black, and suspended by asses' ears,
swung from     he cross-    rees of an old     op-mas    , plan    ed in fron     of an
old doorway. The horns of     he cross-    rees were sawed off on     he o    her
side, so     ha         his old     op-mas     looked no     a li        le like a
gallows. Perhaps I was over sensi    ive     o such impressions a         he
    ime, bu     I could no     help s    aring a         his gallows wi    h a vague
misgiving. A sor     of crick was in my neck as I gazed up     o     he     wo
remaining horns; yes,     wo of     hem, one for Queequeg, and one for
me. I    's ominous,     hinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my
firs     whaling por    ;     ombs    ones s    aring a     me in     he whalemen's
chapel, and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black po    s     oo!
Are     hese las         hrowing ou     oblique hin    s     ouching Tophe    ?

I was called from     hese reflec    ions by     he sigh     of a freckled woman
wi    h yellow hair and a yellow gown, s    anding in     he porch of     he inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging     here,     ha     looked much like an
injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding wi    h a man in a purple
woollen shir    .

"Ge     along wi    h ye," said she     o     he man, "or I'll be combing ye!"

"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all righ    . There's Mrs. Hussey."

And so i         urned ou    ; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, bu     leaving
Mrs. Hussey en    irely compe    en         o a        end     o all his affairs. Upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
pos    poning fur    her scolding for     he presen    , ushered us in    o a li        le
room, and sea    ing us a     a     able spread wi    h     he relics of a recen    ly
concluded repas    ,     urned round     o us and said- "Clam or Cod?"

"Wha    's     ha     abou     Cods, ma'am?" said I, wi    h much poli    eness.

"Clam or Cod?" she repea    ed.

"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is     ha     wha     you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"
says I, "bu         ha    's a ra    her cold and clammy recep    ion in     he win    er
    ime, ain'     i    , Mrs.  Hussey?"

Bu     being in a grea     hurry     o resume scolding     he man in     he purple
shir     who was wai    ing for i     in     he en    ry, and seeming     o hear
no    hing bu         he word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried     owards an open door
leading     o     he ki    chen, and bawling ou     "clam for     wo," disappeared.

"Queequeg," said I, "do you     hink     ha     we can make a supper for us
bo    h on one clam?"

However, a warm savory s    eam from     he ki    chen served     o belie     he
apparen    ly cheerless prospec     before us. Bu     when     ha     smoking
chowder came in,     he mys    ery was deligh    fully explained. Oh! swee    
friends, hearken     o me. I     was made of small juicy clams, scarcely
bigger     han hazel nu    s, mixed wi    h pounded ship biscui    s, and sal    ed
pork cu     up in    o li        le flakes!     he whole enriched wi    h bu        er, and
plen    ifully seasoned wi    h pepper and sal    . Our appe    i    es being
sharpened by     he fros    y voyage, and in par    icular, Queequeg seeing
his favouri    e fishing food before him, and     he chowder being
surpassingly excellen    , we despa    ched i     wi    h grea     expedi    ion: when
leaning back a momen     and be    hinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod
announcemen    , I     hough     I would     ry a li        le experimen    . S    epping     o
    he ki    chen door, I u        ered     he word "cod" wi    h grea     emphasis, and
resumed my sea    . In a few momen    s     he savoury s    eam came for    h again,
bu     wi    h a differen     flavor, and in good     ime a fine cod-chowder was
placed before us.

We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in     he bowl,     hinks
I     o myself, I wonder now if     his here has any effec     on     he head?
Wha    's     ha     s    ul    ifying saying abou     chowder-headed people? "Bu    
look, Queequeg, ain'         ha     a live eel in your bowl?  Where's your
harpoon?"

Fishies     of all fishy places was     he Try Po    s, which well deserved
i    s name; for     he po    s     here were always boiling chowders. Chowder
for breakfas    , and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper,     ill
you began     o look for fish-bones coming     hrough your clo    hes.  The
area before     he house was paved wi    h clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a
polished necklace of codfish ver    ebra; and Hosea Hussey had his
accoun     books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy
flavor     o     he milk,     oo, which I could no     a     all accoun     for,     ill
one morning happening     o     ake a s    roll along     he beach among some
fishermen's boa    s, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish
remnan    s, and marching along     he sand wi    h each foo     in a cod's
decapi    a    ed head, looking very slipshod, I assure ye.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and direc    ions from Mrs. Hussey
concerning     he neares     way     o bed; bu    , as Queequeg was abou         o
precede me up     he s    airs,     he lady reached for    h her arm, and
demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  "Why
no    ? said I; "every     rue whaleman sleeps wi    h his harpoon- bu     why
no    ?" "Because i    's dangerous," says she. "Ever since young S    iggs
coming from     ha     unfor    'n     v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years
and a half, wi    h only     hree barrels of ile, was found dead in my
firs     floor back, wi    h his harpoon in his side; ever since     hen I
allow no boarders     o     ake sich dangerous weepons in     heir rooms a    
nigh    . So, Mr. Queequeg" (for she had learned his name), "I will jus    
    ake     his here iron, and keep i     for you     ill morning. Bu         he
chowder; clam or cod     o-morrow for breakfas    , men?"

"Bo    h," says I; "and le    's have a couple of smoked herring by way of
varie    y."




The Ship


In bed we concoc    ed our plans for     he morrow. Bu         o my surprise and
no small concern, Queequeg now gave me     o unders    and,     ha     he had
been diligen    ly consul    ing Yojo-     he name of his black li        le god-
and Yojo had     old him     wo or     hree     imes over, and s    rongly insis    ed
upon i     everyway,     ha     ins    ead of our going     oge    her among     he
whaling-flee     in harbor, and in concer     selec    ing our craf    ; ins    ead
of     his, I say, Yojo earnes    ly enjoined     ha         he selec    ion of     he
ship should res     wholly wi    h me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed
befriending us; and, in order     o do so, had already pi    ched upon a
vessel, which, if lef         o myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly ligh    
upon, for all     he world as     hough i     had     urned ou     by chance; and in
    ha     vessel I mus     immedia    ely ship myself, for     he presen    
irrespec    ive of Queequeg.

I have forgo        en     o men    ion     ha    , in many     hings, Queequeg placed
grea     confidence in     he excellence of Yojo's judgmen     and surprising
forecas     of     hings; and cherished Yojo wi    h considerable es    eem, as a
ra    her good sor     of god, who perhaps mean     well enough upon     he
whole, bu     in all cases did no     succeed in his benevolen     designs.

Now,     his plan of Queequeg's or ra    her Yojo's,     ouching     he selec    ion
of our craf    ; I did no     like     ha     plan a     all. I had no     a li        le
relied upon Queequeg's sagaci    y     o poin     ou         he whaler bes     fi        ed
    o carry us and our for    unes securely. Bu     as all my remons    rances
produced no effec     upon Queequeg, I was obliged     o acquiesce; and
accordingly prepared     o se     abou         his business wi    h a de    ermined
rushing sor     of energy and vigor,     ha     should quickly se        le     ha    
    rifling li        le affair. Nex     morning early, leaving Queequeg shu     up
wi    h in our li        le bedroom- for i     seemed     ha     i     was some sor     of
Len     or Ramadan, or day of fas    ing, humilia    ion, and prayer wi    h
Queequeg and Yojo     ha     day; how i     was I never could find ou    , for,
    hough I applied myself     o i     several     imes, I never could mas    er his
li    urgies and XXXIX Ar    icles- leaving Queequeg,     hen, fas    ing on his
    omahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself a     his sacrificial fire of
shavings, I sallied ou     among     he shipping. Af    er much prolonged
saun    ering, and many random inquiries, I learn         ha         here were     hree
ships up for     hree-years' voyages- The Devil-dam,     he Ti    -bi    , and
    he Pequod. Devil-dam, I do no     know     he origin of; Ti    -bi     is
obvious; Pequod you will no doub     remember, was     he name of a
celebra    ed     ribe of Massachuse        s Indians; now ex    inc     as     he ancien    
Medes. I peered and pryed abou         he Devil-dam; from her, hopped over
    o     he Ti    -bi    ; and finally, going on board     he Pequod, looked around
her for a momen    , and     hen decided     ha         his was     he very ship for
us.

You may have seen many a quain     craf     in your day, for augh     I know;-
square-    oed luggers; moun    ainous Japanese junks; bu        er-box gallio    s,
and wha     no    ; bu         ake my word for i    , you never saw such a rare old
craf     as     his same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of     he old school,
ra    her small if any    hing; wi    h an old-fashioned claw-foo    ed look
abou     her. Long seasoned and wea    her-s    ained in     he     yphoons and
calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like
a French grenadier's, who has alike fough     in Egyp     and Siberia. Her
venerable bows looked bearded. Her mas    s- cu     somewhere on     he coas    
of Japan, where her original ones were los     overboard in a gale- her
mas    s s    ood s    iffly up like     he spines of     he     hree old kings of
Cologne. Her ancien     decks were worn and wrinkled, like     he
pilgrim-worshipped flag-s    one in Can    erbury Ca    hedral where Becke    
bled. Bu         o all     hese her old an    iqui    ies, were added new and
marvellous fea    ures, per    aining     o     he wild business     ha     for more
    han half a cen    ury she had followed. Old Cap    ain Peleg, many years
her chief-ma    e, before he commanded ano    her vessel of his own, and
now a re    ired seaman, and one of     he principal owners of     he Pequod,-
    his old Peleg, during     he     erm of his chief-ma    eship, had buil     upon
her original gro    esqueness, and inlaid i    , all over, wi    h a
quain    ness bo    h of ma    erial and device, unma    ched by any    hing excep    
i     be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or beds    ead. She was apparelled
like any barbaric E    hiopian emperor, his neck heavy wi    h pendan    s of
polished ivory. She was a     hing of     rophies. A cannibal of a craf    ,
    ricking herself for    h in     he chased bones of her enemies. All round,
her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one con    inuous jaw,
wi    h     he long sharp     ee    h of     he sperm whale, inser    ed     here for
pins,     o fas    en her old hempen     hews and     endons     o. Those     hews ran
no         hrough base blocks of land wood, bu     def    ly     ravelled over
sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a     urns    ile wheel a     her reverend
helm, she spor    ed     here a     iller; and     ha         iller was in one mass,
curiously carved from     he long narrow lower jaw of her heredi    ary
foe. The helmsman who s    eered     ha         iller in a     empes    , fel     like     he
Tar    ar, when he holds back his fiery s    eed by clu    ching i    s jaw. A
noble craf    , bu     somehow a mos     melancholy! All noble     hings are
    ouched wi    h     ha    .

Now when I looked abou         he quar    er-deck, for some one having
au    hori    y, in order     o propose myself as a candida    e for     he voyage,
a     firs     I saw nobody; bu     I could no     well overlook a s    range sor    
of     en    , or ra    her wigwam, pi    ched a li        le behind     he main-mas    .  I    
seemed only a     emporary erec    ion used in por    . I     was of a conical
shape, some     en fee     high; consis    ing of     he long, huge slabs of
limber black bone     aken from     he middle and highes     par     of     he jaws
of     he righ    -whale. Plan    ed wi    h     heir broad ends on     he deck, a
circle of     hese slabs laced     oge    her, mu    ually sloped     owards each
o    her, and a         he apex uni    ed in a     uf    ed poin    , where     he loose
hairy fibres waved     o and fro like     he     op-kno     on some old
Po        owo        amie Sachem's head. A     riangular opening faced     owards     he
bows of     he ship, so     ha         he insider commanded a comple    e view
forward.

And half concealed in     his queer     enemen    , I a     leng    h found one who
by his aspec     seemed     o have au    hori    y; and who, i     being noon, and
    he ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respi    e from     he burden
of command. He was sea    ed on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling
all over wi    h curious carving; and     he bo        om of which was formed of
a s    ou     in    erlacing of     he same elas    ic s    uff of which     he wigwam was
cons    ruc    ed.

There was no    hing so very par    icular, perhaps, abou         he appearance
of     he elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like mos     old
seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilo    -clo    h, cu     in     he Quaker
s    yle; only     here was a fine and almos     microscopic ne    -work of     he
minu    es     wrinkles in    erlacing round eyes, which mus     have arisen from
his con    inual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking     o
windward;- for     his causes     he muscles abou         he eyes     o become
pursed     oge    her. Such eye-wrinkles are very effec    ual in a scowl.

"Is     his     he Cap    ain of     he Pequod?" said I, advancing     o     he door of
    he     en    .

"Supposing i     be     he cap    ain of     he Pequod, wha     dos         hou wan     of
him?" he demanded.

"I was     hinking of shipping."

"Thou was    , was         hou? I see     hou ar     no Nan    ucke    er- ever been in a
s    ove boa    ?"

"No, Sir, I never have."

"Dos     know no    hing a     all abou     whaling, I dare say- eh?

"No    hing, Sir; bu     I have no doub     I shall soon learn. I've been
several voyages in     he merchan     service, and I     hink     ha    -"

"Merchan     service be damned. Talk no         ha     lingo     o me. Dos     see     ha    
leg?- I'll     ake     ha     leg away from     hy s    ern, if ever     hou     alkes     of
    he merchan     service     o me again. Marchan     service indeed! I suppose
now ye feel considerable proud of having served in     hose marchan    
ships. Bu     flukes! man, wha     makes     hee wan         o go a whaling, eh?- i    
looks a li        le suspicious, don'     i    , eh?- Has     no     been a pira    e,
has         hou?- Dids     no     rob     hy las     Cap    ain, dids         hou?- Dos     no    
    hink of murdering     he officers when     hou ge        es         o sea?"

I pro    es    ed my innocence of     hese     hings. I saw     ha     under     he mask
of     hese half humorous innuendoes,     his old seaman, as an insula    ed
Quakerish Nan    ucke    er, was full of his insular prejudices, and ra    her
dis    rus    ful of all aliens, unless     hey hailed from Cape Cod or     he
Vineyard.

"Bu     wha         akes     hee a-whaling? I wan         o know     ha     before I     hink of
shipping ye."

"Well, sir, I wan         o see wha     whaling is. I wan         o see     he world."

"Wan         o see wha     whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Cap    ain
Ahab?"

"Who is Cap    ain Ahab, sir?"

"Aye, aye, I     hough     so. Cap    ain Ahab is     he Cap    ain of     his ship."

"I am mis    aken     hen. I     hough     I was speaking     o     he Cap    ain
himself."

"Thou ar     speaking     o Cap    ain Peleg-     ha    's who ye are speaking     o,
young man. I     belongs     o me and Cap    ain Bildad     o see     he Pequod
fi        ed ou     for     he voyage, and supplied wi    h all her needs, including
crew. We are par     owners and agen    s. Bu     as I was going     o say, if
    hou wan    es         o know wha     whaling is, as     hou     elles     ye do, I can
pu     ye in a way of finding i     ou     before ye bind yourself     o i    , pas    
backing ou    . Clap eye on Cap    ain Ahab, young man, and     hou wil     find
    ha     he has only one leg."

"Wha     do you mean, sir? Was     he o    her one los     by a whale?"

"Los     by a whale! Young man, come nearer     o me: i     was devoured,
chewed up, crunched by     he mons    rouses     parmace        y     ha     ever chipped
a boa    !- ah, ah!"

I was a li        le alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a li        le     ouched
a         he hear    y grief in his concluding exclama    ion, bu     said as calmly
as I could, "Wha     you say is no doub         rue enough, sir; bu     how could
I know     here was any peculiar feroci    y in     ha     par    icular whale,
    hough indeed I migh     have inferred as much from     he simple fac     of
    he acciden    ."

"Look ye now, young man,     hy lungs are a sor     of sof    , d'ye see;     hou
dos     no         alk shark a bi    . Sure, ye've been     o sea before now; sure
of     ha    ?"

"Sir," said I, "I     hough     I     old you     ha     I had been four voyages in
    he merchan    -"

"Hard down ou     of     ha    ! Mind wha     I said abou         he marchan     service-
don'     aggrava    e me- I won'     have i    . Bu     le     us unders    and each
o    her. I have given     hee a hin     abou     wha     whaling is! do ye ye     feel
inclined for i    ?"

"I do, sir."

"Very good. Now, ar         hou     he man     o pi    ch a harpoon down a live
whale's     hroa    , and     hen jump af    er i    ? Answer, quick!"

"I am, sir, if i     should be posi    ively indispensable     o do so; no         o
be go     rid of,     ha     is; which I don'         ake     o be     he fac    ."

"Good again. Now     hen,     hou no     only wan    es         o go a-whaling,     o find
ou     by experience wha     whaling is, bu     ye also wan         o go in order     o
see     he world? Was no         ha     wha     ye said? I     hough     so. Well     hen,
jus     s    ep forward     here, and     ake a peep over     he wea    her bow, and
    hen back     o me and     ell me wha     ye see     here."

For a momen     I s    ood a li        le puzzled by     his curious reques    , no    
knowing exac    ly how     o     ake i    , whe    her humorously or in earnes    . Bu    
concen    ra    ing all his crow's fee     in    o one scowl, Cap    ain Peleg
s    ar    ed me on     he errand.

Going forward and glancing over     he wea    her bow, I perceived     ha         he
ship swinging     o her anchor wi    h     he flood-    ide, was now obliquely
poin    ing     owards     he open ocean. The prospec     was unlimi    ed, bu    
exceedingly mono    onous and forbidding; no         he sligh    es     varie    y     ha    
I could see.

"Well, wha    's     he repor    ?" said Peleg when I came back; "wha     did ye
see?"

"No     much," I replied- "no    hing bu     wa    er; considerable horizon
    hough, and     here's a squall coming up, I     hink."

"Well, wha     does     hou     hink     hen of seeing     he world? Do ye wish     o
go round Cape Horn     o see any more of i    , eh? Can'     ye see     he world
where you s    and?"

I was a li        le s    aggered, bu     go a-whaling I mus    , and I would; and
    he Pequod was as good a ship as any- I     hough         he bes    - and all
    his I now repea    ed     o Peleg. Seeing me so de    ermined, he expressed
his willingness     o ship me.

"And     hou mayes     as well sign     he papers righ     off," he added- "come
along wi    h ye." And so saying, he led     he way below deck in    o     he
cabin.

Sea    ed on     he     ransom was wha     seemed     o me a mos     uncommon and
surprising figure. I         urned ou         o be Cap    ain Bildad who along wi    h
Cap    ain Peleg was one of     he larges     owners of     he vessel;     he o    her
shares, as is some    imes     he case in     hese por    s, being held by a
crowd of old annui    an    s; widows, fa    herless children, and chancery
wards; each owning abou         he value of a     imber head, or a foo     of
plank, or a nail or     wo in     he ship. People in Nan    ucke     inves         heir
money in whaling vessels,     he same way     ha     you do yours in approved
s    a    e s    ocks bringing in good in    eres    .

Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many o    her Nan    ucke    ers, was a
Quaker,     he island having been originally se        led by     ha     sec    ; and
    o     his day i    s inhabi    an    s in general re    ain in an uncommon measure
peculiari    ies of     he Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified
by     hings al    oge    her alien and he    erogeneous. For some of     hese same
Quakers are     he mos     sanguinary of all sailors and
whale-hun    ers. They are figh    ing Quakers;     hey are Quakers wi    h a
vengeance.

So     ha         here are ins    ances among     hem of men, who, named wi    h
Scrip    ure names- a singularly common fashion on     he island- and in
childhood na    urally imbibing     he s    a    ely drama    ic     hee and     hou of
    he Quaker idiom; s    ill, from     he audacious, daring, and boundless
adven    ure of     heir subsequen     lives, s    rangely blend wi    h     hese
unou    grown peculiari    ies, a     housand bold dashes of charac    er, no

or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin volun    ary and
confiding breas    , and     hereby chiefly, bu     wi    h some help from
acciden    al advan    ages,     o learn a bold and nervous lof    y language-
    ha     man makes one in a whole na    ion's census- a migh    y pagean

    hrough a cer    ain morbidness. Be sure of     his, O young ambi    ion, all
mor    al grea    ness is bu     disease. Bu    , as ye     we have no         o do wi    h

peculiar, i     only resul    s again from ano    her phase of     he Quaker,
modified by individual circums    ances.

Like Cap    ain Peleg, Cap    ain Bildad was a well-    o-do, re    ired
whaleman. Bu     unlike Cap    ain Peleg- who cared no     a rush for wha     are
called serious     hings, and indeed deemed     hose self-same serious
    hings     he veries     of all     rifles- Cap    ain Bildad had no     only been
originally educa    ed according     o     he s    ric    es     sec     of Nan    ucke    
Quakerism, bu     all his subsequen     ocean life, and     he sigh     of many
unclad, lovely island crea    ures, round     he Horn- all     ha     had no    
moved     his na    ive born Quaker one single jo    , had no     so much as
al    ered one angle of his ves    . S    ill, for all     his immu    ableness, was
    here some lack of common consis    ency abou     wor    hy Cap    ain
Peleg. Though refusing, from conscien    ious scruples,     o bear arms
agains     land invaders, ye     himself had illimi    ably invaded     he
A    lan    ic and Pacific; and     hough a sworn foe     o human bloodshed, ye    
had he in his s    raigh    -bodied coa    , spilled     uns upon     uns of
levia    han gore. How now in     he con    empla    ive evening of his days,     he
pious Bildad reconciled     hese     hings in     he reminiscence, I do no    
know; bu     i     did no     seem     o concern him much, and very probably he
had long since come     o     he sage and sensible conclusion     ha     a man's
religion is one     hing, and     his prac    ical world qui    e ano    her. This
world pays dividends. Rising from a li        le cabin boy in shor     clo    hes
of     he drabbes     drab,     o a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied
wais    coa    ; from     ha     becoming boa    -header, chief ma    e, and cap    ain,
and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hin    ed before, had concluded
his adven    urous career by wholly re    iring from ac    ive life a         he
goodly age of six    y, and dedica    ing his remaining days     o     he quie    
receiving of his well-earned income.

Now, Bildad, I am sorry     o say, had     he repu    a    ion of being an
incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bi        er, hard
    ask-mas    er. They     old me in Nan    ucke    ,     hough i     cer    ainly seems a
curious s    ory,     ha     when he sailed     he old Ca    egu     whaleman, his
crew, upon arriving home, were mos    ly all carried ashore     o     he
hospi    al, sore exhaus    ed and worn ou    . For a pious man, especially
for a Quaker, he was cer    ainly ra    her hard-hear    ed,     o say     he
leas    . He never used     o swear,     hough, a     his men,     hey said; bu    
somehow he go     an inordina    e quan    i    y of cruel, unmi    iga    ed hard work
ou     of     hem. When Bildad was a chief-ma    e,     o have his drab-colored
eye in    en    ly looking a     you, made you feel comple    ely nervous,     ill
you could clu    ch some    hing- a hammer or a marrling-spike, and go     o
work like mad, a     some    hing or o    her, never mind wha    . Indolence and
idleness perished before him. His own person was     he exac     embodimen    
of his u    ili    arian charac    er.  On his long, gaun     body, he carried no
spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a sof    , economical
nap     o i    , like     ha     worn nap of his broad-brimmed ha    .

Such,     hen, was     he person     ha     I saw sea    ed on     he     ransom when I
followed Cap    ain Peleg down in    o     he cabin. The space be    ween     he
decks was small; and     here, bol     uprigh    , sa     old Bildad, who always
sa     so, and never leaned, and     his     o save his coa    -    ails. His
broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were s    iffly crossed; his
drab ves    ure was bu        oned up     o his chin; and spec    acles on nose, he
seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.

"Bildad," cried Cap    ain Peleg, "a     i     again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
s    udying     hose Scrip    ures, now, for     he las         hir    y years,     o my
cer    ain knowledge. How far ye go    , Bildad?"

As if long habi    ua    ed     o such profane     alk from his old shipma    e,
Bildad, wi    hou     no    icing his presen     irreverence, quie    ly looked up,
and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly     owards Peleg.

"He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he wan    s     o ship."

"Dos         hee?" said Bildad, in a hollow     one, and     urning round     o me.

"I dos    ," said I unconsciously, he was so in    ense a Quaker.

"Wha     do ye     hink of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.

"He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and     hen wen     on spelling away a    
his book in a mumbling     one qui    e audible.

I     hough     him     he queeres     old Quaker I ever saw, especially as
Peleg, his friend and old shipma    e, seemed such a blus    erer. Bu     I
said no    hing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now     hrew open a
ches    , and drawing for    h     he ship's ar    icles, placed pen and ink
before him, and sea    ed himself a     a li        le     able. I began     o     hink i    
was high     ime     o se        le wi    h myself a     wha         erms I would be willing
    o engage for     he voyage. I was already aware     ha     in     he whaling
business     hey paid no wages; bu     all hands, including     he cap    ain,
received cer    ain shares of     he profi    s called lays, and     ha         hese
lays were propor    ioned     o     he degree of impor    ance per    aining     o     he
respec    ive du    ies of     he ship's company. I was also aware     ha     being
a green hand a     whaling, my own lay would no     be very large; bu    
considering     ha     I was used     o     he sea, could s    eer a ship, splice a
rope, and all     ha    , I made no doub         ha     from all I had heard I
should be offered a     leas         he 275    h lay-     ha     is,     he 275    h par     of
    he clear ne     proceeds of     he voyage, wha    ever     ha     migh     even    ually
amoun         o. And     hough     he 275    h lay was wha         hey call a ra    her long
lay, ye     i     was be        er     han no    hing; and if we had a lucky voyage,
migh     pre        y nearly pay for     he clo    hing I would wear ou     on i    , no    
    o speak of my     hree years' beef and board, for which I would no    
have     o pay one s    iver.

I     migh     be     hough         ha         his was a poor way     o accumula    e a princely
for    une- and so i     was, a very poor way indeed. Bu     I am one of     hose
who never     ake on abou     princely for    unes, and am qui    e con    en     if
    he world is ready     o board and lodge me, while I am pu        ing up a    
    his grim sign of     he Thunder Cloud. Upon     he whole, I     hough         he
275    h lay would be abou         he fair     hing, bu     would no     have been
surprised had I been offered     he 200    h, considering I was of a
broad-shouldered make.

Bu     one     hing, never    heless,     ha     made me a li        le dis    rus    ful abou    
receiving a generous share of     he profi    s was     his: Ashore, I had
heard some    hing of bo    h Cap    ain Peleg and his unaccoun    able old crony
Bildad; how     ha         hey being     he principal proprie    ors of     he Pequod,
    herefore     he o    her and more inconsiderable and sca        ered owners,
lef     nearly     he whole managemen     of     he ship's affairs     o     hese
    wo. And I did no     know bu     wha         he s    ingy old Bildad migh     have a
migh    y deal     o say abou     shipping hands, especially as I now found
him on board     he Pequod, qui    e a     home     here in     he cabin, and
reading his Bible as if a     his own fireside. Now while Peleg was
vainly     rying     o mend a pen wi    h his jack-knife, old Bildad,     o my no
small surprise, considering     ha     he was such an in    eres    ed par    y in
    hese proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, bu     wen     on mumbling     o
himself ou     of his book, "Lay no     up for yourselves     reasures upon
ear    h, where mo    h-"

"Well, Cap    ain Bildad," in    errup    ed Peleg, "wha     d'ye say, wha     lay
shall we give     his young man?"

"Thou knowes     bes    ," was     he sepulchral reply, "    he seven hundred and
seven    y-seven    h wouldn'     be     oo much, would i    ?- 'where mo    h and rus    
do corrup    , bu     lay-'"

Lay, indeed,     hough     I, and such a lay!     he seven hundred and
seven    y-seven    h! Well, old Bildad, you are de    ermined     ha     I, for
one, shall no     lay up many lays here below, where mo    h and rus     do
corrup    . I     was an exceedingly long lay     ha    , indeed; and     hough from
    he magni    ude of     he figure i     migh     a     firs     deceive a landsman, ye    
    he sligh    es     considera    ion will show     ha         hough seven hundred and
seven    y-seven is a pre        y large number, ye    , when you come     o make a
    een    h of i    , you will     hen see, I say,     ha         he seven hundred and
seven    y-seven    h par     of a for    hing is a good deal less     han seven
hundred and seven    y-seven gold doubloons; and so I     hough     a         he
    ime.

"Why, blas     your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "    hou dos     no     wan         o
swindle     his young man! he mus     have more     han     ha    ."

"Seven hundred and seven    y-seven    h," again said Bildad, wi    hou    
lif    ing his eyes; and     hen wen     on mumbling- "for where your     reasure
is,     here will your hear     be also."

"I am going     o pu     him down for     he     hree hundred    h," said Peleg, "do
ye hear     ha    , Bildad! The     hree hundred    h lay, I say."

Bildad laid down his book, and     urning solemnly     owards him said,
"Cap    ain Peleg,     hou has     a generous hear    ; bu         hou mus     consider
    he du    y     hou owes         o     he o    her owners of     his ship- widows and
orphans, many of     hem- and     ha     if we     oo abundan    ly reward     he
labors of     his young man, we may be     aking     he bread from     hose
widows and     hose orphans.  The seven hundred and seven    y-seven    h lay,
Cap    ain Peleg."

"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, s    ar    ing up and cla        ering abou         he
cabin.  "Blas     ye, Cap    ain Bildad, if I had followed     hy advice in
    hese ma        ers, I would afore now had a conscience     o lug abou         ha    
would be heavy enough     o founder     he larges     ship     ha     ever sailed
round Cape Horn."

"Cap    ain Peleg," said Bildad s    eadily, "    hy conscience may be drawing
    en inches of wa    er, or     en fa    homs, I can'         ell; bu     as     hou ar    
s    ill an impeni    en     man, Cap    ain Peleg, I grea    ly fear les         hy
conscience be bu     a leaky one; and will in     he end sink     hee
foundering down     o     he fiery pi    , Cap    ain Peleg."

"Fiery pi    ! fiery pi    ! ye insul     me, man; pas     all na    ural bearing,
ye insul     me.  I    's an all-fired ou    rage     o     ell any human crea    ure
    ha     he's bound     o hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say     ha     again     o
me, and s    ar     my soulbol    s, bu     I'll- I'll- yes, I'll swallow a live
goa     wi    h all his hair and horns on. Ou     of     he cabin, ye can    ing,
drab-colored son of a wooden gun- a s    raigh     wake wi    h ye!"

As he     hundered ou         his he made a rush a     Bildad, bu     wi    h a
marvellous oblique, sliding celeri    y, Bildad for     ha         ime eluded
him.

Alarmed a         his     errible ou    burs     be    ween     he     wo principal and
responsible owners of     he ship, and feeling half a mind     o give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so ques    ionably owned and     emporarily
commanded, I s    epped aside from     he door     o give egress     o Bildad,
who, I made no doub    , was all eagerness     o vanish from before     he
awakened wra    h of Peleg. Bu         o my as    onishmen    , he sa     down again on
    he     ransom very quie    ly, and seemed     o have no         he sligh    es    
in    en    ion of wi    hdrawing. He seemed qui    e used     o impeni    en     Peleg
and his ways. As for Peleg, af    er le        ing off his rage as he had,
    here seemed no more lef     in him, and he,     oo, sa     down like a lamb,
    hough he     wi    ched a li        le as if s    ill nervously agi    a    ed. "Whew!"
he whis    led a     las    - "    he squall's gone off     o leeward, I
    hink. Bildad,     hou used     o be good a     sharpening a lance, mend     ha    
pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs     he grinds    one. Tha    's he;
    hank ye, Bildad.  Now     hen, my young man, Ishmael's     hy name, didn'    
ye say? Well     hen, down ye go here, for     he     hree hundred    h lay."

"Cap    ain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend wi    h me who wan    s     o ship
    oo- shall I bring him down     o-morrow?"

"To be sure," said Peleg. "Fe    ch him along, and we'll look a     him."

"Wha     lay does he wan    ?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from     he Book in
which he had again been burying himself.

"Oh! never     hee mind abou         ha    , Bildad," said Peleg. "Has he ever
whaled i     any?"     urning     o me.

"Killed more whales     han I can coun    , Cap    ain Peleg."

"Well, bring him along     hen."

And, af    er signing     he papers, off I wen    ; no    hing doub    ing bu         ha    
I had done a good morning's work, and     ha         he Pequod was     he
iden    ical ship     ha     Yojo had provided     o carry Queequeg and me round
    he Cape.

Bu     I had no     proceeded far, when I began     o be    hink me     ha         he
Cap    ain wi    h whom I was     o sail ye     remained unseen by me;     hough,
indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be comple    ely fi        ed ou    ,
and receive all her crew on board, ere     he cap    ain makes himself
visible by arriving     o     ake command; for some    imes     hese voyages are
so prolonged, and     he shore in    ervals a     home so exceedingly brief,
    ha     if     he cap    ain have family, or any absorbing concernmen     of     ha    
sor    , he does no         rouble himself much abou     his ship in por    , bu    
leaves her     o     he owners     ill all is ready for sea. However, i     is
always as well     o have a look a     him before irrevocably commi        ing
yourself in    o his hands. Turning back I accos    ed Cap    ain Peleg,
inquiring where Cap    ain Ahab was     o be found.

"And wha     dos         hou wan     of Cap    ain Ahab? I    's all righ     enough;     hou
ar     shipped."

"Yes, bu     I should like     o see him."

"Bu     I don'         hink     hou wil     be able     o a     presen    . I don'     know
exac    ly wha    's     he ma        er wi    h him; bu     he keeps close inside     he
house; a sor     of sick, and ye     he don'     look so. In fac    , he ain'    
sick; bu     no, he isn'     well ei    her. Any how, young man, he won'    
always see me, so I don'     suppose he will     hee. He's a queer man,
Cap    ain Ahab- so some     hink- bu     a good one. Oh,     hou'l     like him
well enough; no fear, no fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,
Cap    ain Ahab; doesn'     speak much; bu    , when he does speak,     hen you
may well lis    en. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above     he common;
Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong     he cannibals; been used     o
deeper wonders     han     he waves; fixed his fiery lance in migh    ier,
s    ranger foes     han whales. His lance! aye,     he keenes     and sures    
    ha     ou     of all our isle! Oh! he ain'     Cap    ain Bildad; no, and he
ain'     Cap    ain Peleg; he's Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old,     hou knowes    ,
was a crowned king!"

"And a very vile one. When     ha     wicked king was slain,     he dogs, did
    hey no     lick his blood?"

"Come hi    her     o me- hi    her, hi    her," said Peleg, wi    h a significance
in his eye     ha     almos     s    ar    led me. "Look ye, lad; never say     ha     on
board     he Pequod. Never say i     anywhere. Cap    ain Ahab did no     name
himself .'Twas a foolish, ignoran     whim of his crazy, widowed mo    her,
who died when he was only a     welvemon    h old. And ye         he old squaw
Tis    ig, a     Gayhead, said     ha         he name would somehow prove
prophe    ic. And, perhaps, o    her fools like her may     ell     hee     he
same. I wish     o warn     hee. I    's a lie. I know Cap    ain Ahab well; I've
sailed wi    h him as ma    e years ago; know wha     he is- a good man- no     a
pious, good man, like Bildad, bu     a swearing good man- some    hing like
me- only     here's a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know     ha     he
was never very jolly; and I know     ha     on     he passage home he was a
li        le ou     of his mind for a spell; bu     i     was     he sharp shoo    ing
pains in his bleeding s    ump     ha     brough         ha     abou    , as any one migh    
see. I know,     oo,     ha     ever since he los     his leg las     voyage by     ha    
accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody- despera    e moody, and
savage some    imes; bu         ha     will all pass off. And once for all, le    
me     ell     hee and assure     hee, young man, i    's be        er     o sail wi    h a
moody good cap    ain     han a laughing bad one. So good-bye     o     hee- and
wrong no     Cap    ain Ahab, because he happens     o have a wicked
name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife- no         hree voyages wedded- a
swee    , resigned girl. Think of     ha    ; by     ha     swee     girl     ha     old man
had a child: hold ye     hen     here can be any u        er, hopeless harm in
Ahab? No, no, my lad; s    ricken, blas    ed, if he be, Ahab has his
humani    ies!"

As I walked away, I was full of     hough    fulness; wha     had been
inciden    ally revealed     o me of Cap    ain Ahab, filled me wi    h a cer    ain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, a         he
    ime, I fel     a sympa    hy and a sorrow for him, bu     for I don'     know
wha    , unless i     was     he cruel loss of his leg. And ye     I also fel     a
s    range awe of him; bu         ha     sor     of awe, which I canno     a     all
describe, was no     exac    ly awe; I do no     know wha     i     was. Bu     I fel    
i    ; and i     did no     disincline me     owards him;     hough I fel    
impa    ience a     wha     seemed like mys    ery in him, so imperfec    ly as he
was known     o me     hen.  However, my     hough    s were a     leng    h carried in
o    her direc    ions, so     ha     for     he presen     dark Ahab slipped my mind.




The Ramadan


As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fas    ing and Humilia    ion, was     o con    inue
all day, I did no     choose     o dis    urb him     ill     owards nigh    -fall; for
I cherish     he grea    es     respec         owards everybody's religious
obliga    ions, never mind how comical, and could no     find i     in my
hear         o undervalue even a congrega    ion of an    s worshipping a
    oad-s    ool; or     hose o    her crea    ures in cer    ain par    s of our ear    h,
who wi    h a degree of foo    manism qui    e unpreceden    ed in o    her plane    s,
bow down before     he     orso of a deceased landed proprie    or merely on
accoun     of     he inordina    e possessions ye     owned and ren    ed in his
name.

I say, we good Presby    erian Chris    ians should be chari    able in     hese
    hings, and no     fancy ourselves so vas    ly superior     o o    her mor    als,
pagans and wha     no    , because of     heir half-crazy concei    s on     hese
subjec    s. There was Queequeg, now, cer    ainly en    er    aining     he mos    
absurd no    ions abou     Yojo and his Ramadan;- bu     wha     of     ha    ?
Queequeg     hough     he knew wha     he was abou    , I suppose; he seemed     o
be con    en    ; and     here le     him res    . All our arguing wi    h him would
no     avail; le     him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all-
Presby    erians and Pagans alike- for we are all somehow dreadfully
cracked abou         he head, and sadly need mending.

Towards evening, when I fel     assured     ha     all his performances and
ri    uals mus     be over, I wen         o his room and knocked a         he door; bu    
no answer. I     ried     o open i    , bu     i     was fas    ened
inside. "Queequeg," said I sof    ly     hrough     he key-hole:- all
silen    . "I say, Queequeg! why don'     you speak? I    's I- Ishmael." Bu    
all remained s    ill as before. I began     o grow alarmed. I had allowed
him such abundan         ime; I     hough     he migh     have had an apoplec    ic
fi    . I looked     hrough     he key-hole; bu         he door opening in    o an odd
corner of     he room,     he key-hole prospec     was bu     a crooked and
sinis    er one. I could only see par     of     he foo    -board of     he bed and
a line of     he wall, bu     no    hing more. I was surprised     o behold
res    ing agains         he wall     he wooden shaf     of Queequeg's harpoon,
which     he landlady     he evening previous had     aken from him, before
our moun    ing     o     he chamber. Tha    's s    range,     hough     I; bu     a     any
ra    e, since     he harpoon s    ands yonder, and he seldom or never goes
abroad wi    hou     i    ,     herefore he mus     be inside here, and no possible
mis    ake.

"Queequeg!- Queequeg!"- all s    ill. Some    hing mus     have
happened. Apoplexy! I     ried     o burs     open     he door; bu     i     s    ubbornly
resis    ed. Running down s    airs, I quickly s    a    ed my suspicions     o     he
firs     person I me    -     he chamber-maid. "La! la!" she cried, "I     hough    
some    hing mus         he ma        er. I wen         o make     he bed af    er breakfas    ,
and     he door was locked; and no     a mouse     o be heard; and i    's been
jus     so silen     ever since. Bu     I     hough    , may be, you had bo    h gone
off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma'am!-
Mis    ress! murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"- and wi    h     hese cries she
ran     owards     he ki    chen, I following.

Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, wi    h a mus    ard-po     in one hand and a
vinegar-crue     in     he o    her, having jus     broken away from     he
occupa    ion of a        ending     o     he cas    ors, and scolding her li        le black
boy mean    ime.

"Wood-house!" cried I, "which way     o i    ? Run for God's sake, and
fe    ch some    hing     o pry open     he door-     he axe!-     he axe! he's had a
s    roke; depend upon i    !"- and so saying I was unme    hodically rushing
up s    airs again emp    y-handed, when Mrs. Hussey in    erposed     he
mus    ard-po     and vinegar-crue    , and     he en    ire cas    or of her
coun    enance.

"Wha    's     he ma        er wi    h you, young man?"

"Ge         he axe! For God's sake, run for     he doc    or, some one, while I
pry i     open!"

"Look here," said     he landlady, quickly pu        ing down     he
vinegar-crue    , so as     o have one hand free; "look here; are you
    alking abou     prying open any of my doors?"- and wi    h     ha     she seized
my arm. "Wha    's     he ma        er wi    h you? Wha    's     he ma        er wi    h you,
shipma    e?"

In as calm, bu     rapid a manner as possible, I gave her     o unders    and
    he whole case.  Unconsciously clapping     he vinegar-crue         o one side
of her nose, she rumina    ed for an ins    an    ;     hen exclaimed- "No! I
haven'     seen i     since I pu     i         here." Running     o a li        le close    
under     he landing of     he s    airs, she glanced in, and re    urning,     old
me     ha     Queequeg's harpoon was missing. "He's killed himself," she
cried.  "I    's unfor    'na    e S    iggs done over again     here goes ano    her
coun    erpane- God pi    y his poor mo    her!- i     will be     he ruin of my

ghos    ! Wha    's     ha     noise     here? You, young man, avas         here!"

And running af    er me, she caugh     me as I was again     rying     o force
open     he door.

"I won'     allow i    ; I won'     have my premises spoiled. Go for     he
locksmi    h,     here's one abou     a mile from here. Bu     avas    !" pu        ing
her hand in her side pocke    , "here's a key     ha    'll fi    , I guess;
le    's see." And wi    h     ha    , she     urned i     in     he lock; bu     alas!
Queequeg's supplemen    al bol     remained unwi    hdrawn wi    hin.

"Have     o burs     i     open," said I, and was running down     he en    ry a
li        le, for a good s    ar    , when     he landlady caugh     a     me, again
vowing I should no     break down her premises; bu     I     ore from her, and
wi    h a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full agains         he mark.

Wi    h a prodigious noise     he door flew open, and     he knob slamming
agains         he wall, sen         he plas    er     o     he ceiling; and     here, good
heavens!     here sa     Queequeg, al    oge    her cool on his hams, and holding
Yojo on     op of his head. He looked nei    her one way nor     he o    her way
bu     sa     like a carved image wi    h scarce a sign of ac    ive life.

"Queequeg," said I, going up     o him, "Queequeg, wha    's     he ma        er
wi    h you?"

"He hain'     been a si        in' so all day, has he?" said     he landlady.

Bu     all we said, no     a word could we drag ou     of him; I almos     fel    
like pushing him over, so as     o change his posi    ion, for i     was
almos     in    olerable, i     seemed so painfully and unna    urally
cons    rained; especially, as in all probabili    y he had been si        ing so
for upwards of eigh     or     en hours, going     oo wi    hou     his regular
meals.

"Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's alive a     all even    s; so leave us, if you
please, and I will see     o     his s    range affair myself."

Closing     he door upon     he landlady, I endeavored     o prevail upon
Queequeg     o     ake a chair; bu     in vain. There he sa    ; and all he could
do- for all my poli    e ar    s and blandishmen    s- he would no     move a
peg, nor say a single word, nor even look a     me, nor no    ice my
presence in     he sligh    es     way.

I wonder,     hough     I, if     his can possibly be a par     of his Ramadan;
do     hey fas     on     heir hams     ha     way in his na    ive land. I     mus     be
so; yes, i    's a par     of his creed, I suppose; well,     hen, le     him
res    ; he'll ge     up sooner or la    er, no doub    . I     can'     las     for ever,
    hank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don'    
believe i    's very punc    ual     hen.

I wen     down     o supper. Af    er si        ing a long     ime lis    ening     o     he
long s    ories of some sailors who had jus     come from a plum-pudding
voyage, as     hey called i     (    ha     is, a shor     whaling-voyage in a
schooner or brig, confined     o     he nor    h of     he line, in     he A    lan    ic
Ocean only); af    er lis    ening     o     hese plum-puddingers     ill nearly
eleven o'clock, I wen     up s    airs     o go     o bed, feeling qui    e sure by
    his     ime Queequeg mus     cer    ainly have brough     his Ramadan     o a
    ermina    ion. Bu     no;     here he was jus     where I had lef     him; he had
no     s    irred an inch. I began     o grow vexed wi    h him; i     seemed so
downrigh     senseless and insane     o be si        ing     here all day and half
    he nigh     on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his
head.

"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, ge     up and shake yourself; ge     up and
have some supper. You'll s    arve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg." Bu    
no     a word did he reply.

Despairing of him,     herefore, I de    ermined     o go     o bed and     o sleep;
and no doub    , before a grea     while, he would follow me. Bu     previous
    o     urning in, I     ook my heavy bearskin jacke    , and     hrew i     over
him, as i     promised     o be a very cold nigh    ; and he had no    hing bu    
his ordinary round jacke     on. For some     ime, do all I would, I could
no     ge     in    o     he fain    es     doze. I had blown ou         he candle; and     he
mere     hough     of Queequeg- no     four fee     off- si        ing     here in     ha    
uneasy posi    ion, s    ark alone in     he cold and dark;     his made me
really wre    ched. Think of i    ; sleeping all nigh     in     he same room
wi    h a wide awake pagan on his hams in     his dreary, unaccoun    able
Ramadan!

Bu     somehow I dropped off a     las    , and knew no    hing more     ill break
of day; when, looking over     he bedside,     here squa        ed Queequeg, as
if he had been screwed down     o     he floor. Bu     as soon as     he firs    
glimpse of sun en    ered     he window, up he go    , wi    h s    iff gra    ing
join    s, bu     wi    h a cheerful look; limped     owards me where I lay;
pressed his forehead again agains     mine; and said his Ramadan was
over.

Now, as I before hin    ed, I have no objec    ion     o any person's
religion, be i     wha     i     may, so long as     ha     person does no     kill or
insul     any o    her person, because     ha     o    her person don'     believe i    
also. Bu     when a man's religion becomes really fran    ic; when i     is a
posi    ive     ormen         o him; and, in fine, makes     his ear    h of ours an
uncomfor    able inn     o lodge in;     hen I     hink i     high     ime     o     ake     ha    
individual aside and argue     he poin     wi    h him.

And jus     so I now did wi    h Queequeg. "Queequeg," said I, "ge     in    o
bed now, and lie and lis    en     o me." I     hen wen     on, beginning wi    h
    he rise and progress of     he primi    ive religions, and coming down     o
    he various religions of     he presen         ime, during which     ime I
labored     o show Queequeg     ha     all     hese Len    s, Ramadans, and
prolonged ham-squa        ings in cold, cheerless rooms were s    ark
nonsense; bad for     he heal    h; useless for     he soul; opposed, in
shor    ,     o     he obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I     old him,
    oo,     ha     he being in o    her     hings such an ex    remely sensible and
sagacious savage, i     pained me, very badly pained me,     o see him now
so deplorably foolish abou         his ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides,
argued I, fas    ing makes     he body cave in; hence     he spiri     caves in;
and all     hough    s born of a fas     mus     necessarily be
half-s    arved. This is     he reason why mos     dyspep    ic religionis    s
cherish such melancholy no    ions abou         heir hereaf    ers. In one word,
Queequeg, said I, ra    her digressively; hell is an idea firs     born on
an undiges    ed apple-dumpling; and since     hen perpe    ua    ed     hrough     he
heredi    ary dyspepsias nur    ured by Ramadans.

I     hen asked Queequeg whe    her he himself was ever     roubled wi    h
dyspepsia; expressing     he idea very plainly, so     ha     he could     ake i    
in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. I     was af    er a
grea     feas     given by his fa    her     he king on     he gaining of a grea    
ba        le wherein fif    y of     he enemy had been killed by abou         wo
o'clock in     he af    ernoon, and all cooked and ea    en     ha     very evening.

"No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "    ha     will do;" for I knew
    he inferences wi    hou     his fur    her hin    ing     hem. I had seen a sailor
who had visi    ed     ha     very island, and he     old me     ha     i     was     he
cus    om, when a grea     ba        le had been gained     here,     o barbecue all
    he slain in     he yard or garden of     he vic    or; and     hen, one by one,
    hey were placed in grea     wooden     renchers, and garnished round like
a pilau, wi    h breadfrui     and cocoanu    s; and wi    h some parsley in
    heir mou    hs, were sen     round wi    h     he vic    or's complimen    s     o all
his friends, jus     as     hough     hese presen    s were so many Chris    mas
    urkeys.

Af    er all, I do no         hink     ha     my remarks abou     religion made much
impression upon Queequeg. Because, in     he firs     place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing on     ha     impor    an     subjec    , unless considered
from his own poin     of view; and, in     he second place, he did no     more
    han one     hird unders    and me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
finally, he no doub         hough     he knew a good deal more abou         he     rue
religion     han I did. He looked a     me wi    h a sor     of condescending
concern and compassion, as     hough he     hough     i     a grea     pi    y     ha    
such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly los         o evangelical
pagan pie    y.

A     las     we rose and dressed; and Queequeg,     aking a prodigiously
hear    y breakfas     of chowders of all sor    s, so     ha         he landlady
should no     make much profi     by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied ou    
    o board     he Pequod, saun    ering along, and picking our     ee    h wi    h
halibu     bones.




His Mark


As we were walking down     he end of     he wharf     owards     he ship,
Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Cap    ain Peleg in his gruff voice
loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had no     suspec    ed my
friend was a cannibal, and fur    hermore announcing     ha     he le     no
cannibals on board     ha     craf    , unless     hey previously produced     heir
papers.

"Wha     do you mean by     ha    , Cap    ain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on     he
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade s    anding on     he wharf.

"I mean," he replied, "he mus     show his papers."

"Yes," said Cap    ain Bildad in his hollow voice, s    icking his head
from behind Peleg's, ou     of     he wigwam. "He mus     show     ha     he's
conver    ed. Son of darkness," he added,     urning     o Queequeg, "ar         hou
a     presen     in communion wi    h any Chris    ian church?"

"Why," said I, "he's a member of     he firs     Congrega    ional Church."
Here be i     said,     ha     many     a        ooed savages sailing in Nan    ucke    
ships a     las     come     o be conver    ed in    o     he churches.

"Firs     Congrega    ional Church," cried Bildad, "wha    !     ha     worships in
Deacon Deu    eronomy Coleman's mee    ing-house?" and so saying,     aking
ou     his spec    acles, he rubbed     hem wi    h his grea     yellow bandana
handkerchief, and pu        ing     hem on very carefully, came ou     of     he
wigwam, and leaning s    iffly over     he bulwarks,     ook a good long look
a     Queequeg.

"How long ha    h he been a member?" he     hen said,     urning     o me; "no    
very long, I ra    her guess, young man."

"No," said Peleg, "and he hasn'     been bap    ized righ     ei    her, or i    
would have washed some of     ha     devil's blue off his face."

"Do     ell, now," cried Bildad, "is     his Philis    ine a regular member of
Deacon Deu    eronomy's mee    ing? I never saw him going     here, and I pass
i     every Lord's day."

"I don'     know any    hing abou     Deacon Deu    eronomy or his mee    ing," said
I; "all I know is,     ha     Queequeg here is a born member of     he Firs    
Congrega    ional Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."

"Young man," said Bildad s    ernly, "    hou ar     skylarking wi    h me-
explain     hyself,     hou young Hi        i    e. Wha     church dos         hee mean?
answer me."

Finding myself     hus hard pushed, I replied, "I mean, sir,     he same
ancien     Ca    holic Church     o which you and I, and Cap    ain Peleg     here,
and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mo    her's son and soul of
us belong;     he grea     and everlas    ing Firs     Congrega    ion of     his whole
worshipping world; we all belong     o     ha    ; only some of us cherish
some cro    che    s no ways     ouching     he grand belief; in     ha     we all join
hands."

"Splice,     hou mean's     splice hands," cried Peleg, drawing
nearer. "Young man, you'd be        er ship for a missionary, ins    ead of a
fore-mas     hand; I never heard a be        er sermon. Deacon Deu    eronomy-
why Fa    her Mapple himself couldn'     bea     i    , and he's reckoned
some    hing. Come aboard, come aboard: never mind abou         he papers. I
say,     ell Quohog     here- wha    's     ha     you call him?     ell Quohog     o s    ep
along. By     he grea     anchor, wha     a harpoon he's go         here! looks like
good s    uff     ha    ; and he handles i     abou     righ    .  I say, Quohog, or
wha    ever your name is, did you ever s    and in     he head of a
whale-boa    ?  did you ever s    rike a fish?"

Wi    hou     saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sor     of way, jumped upon
    he bulwarks, from     hence in    o     he bows of one of     he whale-boa    s
hanging     o     he side; and     hen bracing his lef     knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried ou     in some such way as     his:-

"Cap'ain, you see him small drop     ar on wa    er dere? You see him?
well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!" and     aking sharp aim a    
i    , he dar    ed     he iron righ     over old Bildad's broad brim, clean
across     he ship's decks, and s    ruck     he glis    ening     ar spo     ou     of
sigh    .

"Now," said Queequeg, quie    ly, hauling in     he line, "spos-ee him
whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead."

"Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his par    ner, who, aghas     a         he close
vicini    y of     he flying harpoon, had re    rea    ed     owards     he cabin
gangway. "Quick, I say, you Bildad, and ge         he ship's papers. We
mus     have Hedgehog     here, I mean Quohog, in one of our boa    s. Look
ye, Quohog, we'll give ye     he nine    ie    h lay, and     ha    's more     han
ever was given a harpooneer ye     ou     of Nan    ucke    ."

So down we wen     in    o     he cabin, and     o my grea     joy Queequeg was soon
enrolled among     he same ship's company     o which I myself belonged.

When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had go     every    hing ready
for signing, he     urned     o me and said, "I guess, Quohog     here don'    
know how     o wri    e, does he? I say, Quohog, blas     ye! dos         hou sign
    hy name or make     hy mark?

Bu     a         his ques    ion, Queequeg, who had     wice or     hrice before     aken
par     in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; bu         aking     he
offered pen, copied upon     he paper, in     he proper place, an exac    
coun    erpar     of a queer round figure which was     a        ooed upon his arm;

appella    ive, i     s    ood some    hing like     his:-
Quohog.
his X mark. Meanwhile Cap    ain Bildad sa     earnes    ly and s    eadfas    ly
eyeing Queequeg, and a     las     rising solemnly and fumbling in     he huge
pocke    s of his broadskir    ed drab coa         ook ou     a bundle of     rac    s,
and selec    ing one en    i    led "The La        er Day Coming; or No Time     o
Lose," placed i     in Queequeg's hands, and     hen grasping     hem and     he
book wi    h bo    h his, looked earnes    ly in    o his eyes, and said, "Son of
darkness, I mus     do my du    y by     hee; I am par     owner of     his ship,
and feel concerned for     he souls of all i    s crew; if     hou s    ill

hideous dragon;     urn from     he wra    h     o come; mind     hine eye, I say;
oh! goodness gracious! s    eer clear of     he fiery pi    !"

Some    hing of     he sal     sea ye     lingered in old Bildad's language,
he    erogeneously mixed wi    h Scrip    ural and domes    ic phrases.

"Avas         here, avas         here, Bildad, avas     now spoiling our
harpooneer," Peleg.  "Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers- i    
    akes     he shark ou     of 'em; no harpooneer is wor    h a s    raw who ain

of af    er-claps, in case he go     s    ove and wen         o Davy Jones."

"Peleg! Peleg!" said Bildad, lif    ing his eyes and hands, "    hou
    hyself, as I myself, has     seen many a perilous     ime;     hou knowes    ,

"Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across     he cabin, and
    hrus    ing his hands far down in    o his pocke    s,- "hear him, all of

Bildad said no more, bu     bu        oning up his coa    , s    alked on deck,

The Prophe    


"Shipma    es, have ye shipped in     ha     ship?"

Queequeg and I had jus     lef         he Pequod, and were saun    ering from     he
wa    er, for     he momen     each occupied wi    h his own     hough    s, when     he
above words were pu         o us by a s    ranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger a         he vessel in ques    ion. He was bu    
shabbily apparelled in faded jacke     and pa    ched     rowsers; a rag of a
black handkerchief inves    ing his neck. A confluen     smallpox had in
all direc    ions flowed over his face, and lef     i     like     he complica    ed
ribbed bed of a     orren    , when     he rushing wa    ers have been dried up.

"Have ye shipped in her?" he repea    ed.

"You mean     he ship Pequod, I suppose," said I,     rying     o gain a
li        le more     ime for an unin    errup    ed look a     him.

"Aye,     he Pequod-     ha     ship     here," he said, drawing back his whole
arm and     hen rapidly shoving i     s    raigh     ou     from him-, wi    h     he
fixed bayone     of his poin    ed finger dar    ed full a         he objec    .

"Yes," said I, "we have jus     signed     he ar    icles."

"Any    hing down     here abou     your souls?"

"Abou     wha    ?"

"Oh, perhaps you hav'n'     go     any," he said quickly. "No ma        er

and     hey are all     he be        er off for i    . A soul's a sor     of a fif    h

"Wha     are you jabbering abou    , shipma    e?" said I.

"He's go     enough,     hough,     o make up for all deficiencies of     ha    
sor     in o    her chaps," abrup    ly said     he s    ranger, placing a nervous
emphasis upon     he word he.

"Queequeg," said I, "le    's go;     his fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he's     alking abou     some    hing and somebody we don'     know."

"S    op!" cried     he s    ranger. "Ye said     rue- ye hav'n'     seen Old
Thunder ye    , have ye?"

"Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again rive    ed wi    h     he insane
earnes    ness of his manner.

"Cap    ain Ahab."

"Wha    !     he cap    ain of our ship,     he Pequod?"

"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by     ha     name. Ye
hav'n'     seen him ye    , have ye?"

"No, we hav'n'    . He's sick     hey say, bu     is ge        ing be        er, and will
be all righ     again before long."

"All righ     again before long!" laughed     he s    ranger, wi    h a solemnly
derisive sor     of laugh. "Look ye; when Cap    ain Ahab is all righ    ,
    hen     his lef     arm of mine will be all righ    ; no     before."

"Wha     do you know abou     him?"

"Wha     did     hey     ell you abou     him? Say     ha    !"

"They didn'         ell much of any    hing abou     him; only I've heard     ha    
he's a good whale-hun    er, and a good cap    ain     o his crew."

"Tha    's     rue,     ha    's     rue- yes, bo    h     rue enough. Bu     you mus     jump
when he gives an order. S    ep and growl; growl and go-     ha    's     he word
wi    h Cap    ain Ahab. Bu     no    hing abou         ha         hing     ha     happened     o him
off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for     hree days and
nigh    s; no    hing abou         ha     deadly skrimmage wi    h     he Spaniard afore
    he al    ar in San    a?- heard no    hing abou         ha    , eh? No    hing abou         he
silver calabash he spa     in    o? And no    hing abou     his losing his leg
las     voyage, according     o     he prophecy.  Didn'     ye hear a word abou    
    hem ma        ers and some    hing more, eh? No, I don'         hink ye did; how
could ye? Who knows i    ? No     all Nan    ucke    , I guess. Bu     hows'ever,
mayhap, ye've heard     ell abou         he leg, and how he los     i    ; aye, ye
have heard of     ha    , I dare say. Oh, yes,     ha     every one knows a'mos    -
I mean     hey know he's only one leg; and     ha     a parmace        i     ook     he
o    her off."

"My friend," said I, "wha     all     his gibberish of yours is abou    , I
don'     know, and I don'     much care; for i     seems     o me     ha     you mus    
be a li        le damaged in     he head. Bu     if you are speaking of Cap    ain
Ahab, of     ha     ship     here,     he Pequod,     hen le     me     ell you,     ha     I
know all abou         he loss of his leg."

"All abou     i    , eh- sure you do? all?

"Pre        y sure."

Wi    h finger poin    ed and eye levelled a         he Pequod,     he beggar-like
s    ranger s    ood a momen    , as if in a     roubled reverie;     hen s    ar    ing a
li        le,     urned and said:- "Ye've shipped, have ye?  Names down on     he
papers? Well, well, wha    's signed, is signed; and wha    's     o be, will
be; and     hen again, perhaps i     won'     be, af    er all. Any how, i    's all
fixed and arranged already; and some sailors or o    her mus     go wi    h
him, I suppose; as well     hese as any o    her men, God pi    y 'em! Morning
    o ye, shipma    es, morning;     he ineffable heavens bless ye; I'm sorry
I s    opped ye."

"Look here, friend," said I, "if you have any    hing impor    an         o     ell

mis    aken in your game;     ha    's all I have     o say."

"And i    's said very well, and I like     o hear a chap     alk up     ha     way;
you are jus         he man for him-     he likes of ye. Morning     o ye,
shipma    es, morning! Oh! when ye ge         here,     ell 'em I've concluded
no         o make one of 'em."

"Ah, my dear fellow, you can'     fool us     ha     way- you can'     fool
us. I     is     he easies         hing in     he world for a man     o look as if he
had a grea     secre     in him."

"Morning     o ye, shipma    es, morning."

"Morning i     is," said I. "Come along, Queequeg, le    's leave     his
crazy man. Bu     s    op,     ell me your name, will you?"

"Elijah."

Elijah!     hough     I, and we walked away, bo    h commen    ing, af    er each
o    her's fashion, upon     his ragged old sailor; and agreed     ha     he was
no    hing bu     a humbug,     rying     o be a bugbear. Bu     we had no     gone
perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing     o     urn a corner, and
looking back as I did so, who should be seen bu     Elijah following us,
    hough a     a dis    ance. Somehow,     he sigh     of him s    ruck me so,     ha     I
said no    hing     o Queequeg of his being behind, bu     passed on wi    h my
comrade, anxious     o see whe    her     he s    ranger would     urn     he same
corner     ha     we did. He did; and     hen i     seemed     o me     ha     he was
dogging us, bu     wi    h wha     in    en     I could no     for     he life of me
imagine. This circums    ance, coupled wi    h his ambiguous, half-hin    ing,
half-revealing, shrouded sor     of     alk, now bega     in me all kinds of
vague wondermen    s and half-apprehensions, and all connec    ed wi    h     he
Pequod; and Cap    ain Ahab; and     he leg he had los    ; and     he Cape Horn
fi    ; and     he silver calabash; and wha     Cap    ain Peleg had said of him,
when I lef         he ship     he day previous; and     he predic    ion of     he
squaw Tis    ig; and     he voyage we had bound ourselves     o sail; and a
hundred o    her shadowy     hings.

I was resolved     o sa    isfy myself whe    her     his ragged Elijah was
really dogging us or no    , and wi    h     ha     in    en     crossed     he way wi    h
Queequeg, and on     ha     side of i     re    raced our s    eps. Bu     Elijah
passed on, wi    hou     seeming     o no    ice us. This relieved me; and once
more, and finally as i     seemed     o me, I pronounced him in my hear    , a
humbug.




All As    ir


A day or     wo passed, and     here was grea     ac    ivi    y aboard     he
Pequod. No     only were     he old sails being mended, bu     new sails were
coming on board, and bol    s of canvas, and coils of rigging; in shor    ,
every    hing be    okened     ha         he ship's prepara    ions were hurrying     o a
close. Cap    ain Peleg seldom or never wen     ashore, bu     sa     in his
wigwam keeping a sharp look-ou     upon     he hands: Bildad did all     he
purchasing and providing a         he s    ores; and     he men employed in     he
hold and on     he rigging were working     ill long af    er nigh    -fall.

On     he day following Queequeg's signing     he ar    icles, word was given
a     all     he inns where     he ship's company were s    opping,     ha         heir
ches    s mus     be on board before nigh    , for     here was no     elling how
soon     he vessel migh     be sailing. So Queequeg and I go     down our
    raps, resolving, however,     o sleep ashore     ill     he las    . Bu     i    
seems     hey always give very long no    ice in     hese cases, and     he ship
did no     sail for several days.  Bu     no wonder;     here was a good deal
    o be done, and     here is no     elling how many     hings     o be     hough     of,
before     he Pequod was fully equipped.

Every one knows wha     a mul    i    ude of     hings- beds, sauce-pans, knives
and forks, shovels and     ongs, napkins, nu    -crackers, and wha     no    ,
are indispensable     o     he business of housekeeping. Jus     so wi    h
whaling, which necessi    a    es a     hree-years' housekeeping upon     he wide
ocean, far from all grocers, cos    ermongers, doc    ors, bakers, and
bankers. And     hough     his also holds     rue of merchan     vessels, ye     no    
by any means     o     he same ex    en     as wi    h whalemen. For besides     he
grea     leng    h of     he whaling voyage,     he numerous ar    icles peculiar     o
    he prosecu    ion of     he fishery, and     he impossibili    y of replacing
    hem a         he remo    e harbors usually frequen    ed, i     mus     be remembered,
    ha     of all ships, whaling vessels are     he mos     exposed     o acciden    s
of all kinds, and especially     o     he des    ruc    ion and loss of     he very
    hings upon which     he success of     he voyage mos     depends.  Hence,     he
spare boa    s, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare
every    hings, almos    , bu     a spare Cap    ain and duplica    e ship.

A         he period of our arrival a         he Island,     he heavies     s    orage of
    he Pequod had been almos     comple    ed; comprising her beef, bread,
wa    er, fuel, and iron hoops and s    aves. Bu    , as before hin    ed, for
some     ime     here was a con    inual fe    ching and carrying on board of
divers odds and ends of     hings, bo    h large and small.

Chief among     hose who did     his fe    ching and carrying was Cap    ain
Bildad's sis    er, a lean old lady of a mos     de    ermined and
indefa    igable spiri    , bu     wi    hal very kindhear    ed, who seemed
resolved     ha    , if she could help i    , no    hing should be found wan    ing
in     he Pequod, af    er once fairly ge        ing     o sea. A     one     ime she
would come on board wi    h a jar of pickles for     he s    eward's pan    ry;
ano    her     ime wi    h a bunch of quills for     he chief ma    e's desk, where
he kep     his log; a     hird     ime wi    h a roll of flannel for     he small of
some one's rheuma    ic back. Never did any woman be        er deserve her
name, which was Chari    y- Aun     Chari    y, as everybody called her. And
like a sis    er of chari    y did     his chari    able Aun     Chari    y bus    le
abou     hi    her and     hi    her, ready     o     urn her hand and hear         o
any    hing     ha     promised     o yield safe    y, comfor    , and consola    ion     o
all on board a ship in which her beloved bro    her Bildad was
concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or     wo of
well-saved dollars.

Bu     i     was s    ar    ling     o see     his excellen     hear    ed Quakeress coming
on board, as she did     he las     day, wi    h a long oil-ladle in one hand,
and s    ill longer whaling lance in     he o    her. Nor was Bildad himself
nor Cap    ain Peleg a     all backward. As for Bildad, he carried abou    
wi    h him a long lis     of     he ar    icles needed, and a     every fresh
arrival, down wen     his mark opposi    e     ha     ar    icle upon     he
paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling ou     of his whalebone
den, roaring a         he men down     he ha    chways, roaring up     o     he riggers
a         he mas    -head, and     hen concluded by roaring back in    o his wigwam.

During     hese days of prepara    ion, Queequeg and I of    en visi    ed     he
craf    , and as of    en I asked abou     Cap    ain Ahab, and how he was, and
when he was going     o come on board his ship. To     hese ques    ions     hey
would answer,     ha     he was ge        ing be        er and be        er, and was expec    ed
aboard every day; mean    ime,     he     wo cap    ains, Peleg and Bildad, could
a        end     o every    hing necessary     o fi         he vessel for     he voyage. If I
had been downrigh     hones     wi    h myself, I would have seen very plainly
in my hear         ha     I did bu     half fancy being commi        ed     his way     o so
long a voyage, wi    hou     once laying my eyes on     he man who was     o be
absolu    e dic    a    or of i    , so soon as     he ship sailed ou     upon     he open
sea. Bu     when a man suspec    s any wrong, i     some    imes happens     ha     if
he be already involved in     he ma        er, he insensibly s    rives     o cover
up his suspicions even from himself. And much     his way i     was wi    h
me. I said no    hing, and     ried     o     hink no    hing.

A     las     i     was given ou         ha     some     ime nex     day     he ship would
cer    ainly sail.  So nex     morning, Queequeg and I     ook a very early
s    ar    .




Going Aboard


I     was nearly six o'clock, bu     only grey imperfec     mis    y dawn, when
we drew nigh     he wharf.

"There are some sailors running ahead     here, if I see righ    ," said I
    o Queequeg, "i     can'     be shadow; she's off by sunrise, I guess; come
on!"

"Avas    !" cried a voice, whose owner a         he same     ime coming close
behind us, laid a hand upon bo    h our shoulders, and     hen insinua    ing
himself be    ween us, s    ood s    ooping forward a li        le, in     he uncer    ain
    wiligh    , s    rangely peering from Queequeg     o me. I     was Elijah.

"Going aboard?"

"Hands off, will you," said I.

"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

"Ain     going aboard,     hen?"

"Yes, we are," said I, "bu     wha     business is     ha     of yours? Do you
know, Mr. Elijah,     ha     I consider you a li        le imper    inen    ?"

"No, no, no; I wasn'     aware of     ha    ," said Elijah, slowly and
wonderingly looking from me     o Queequeg, wi    h     he mos     unaccoun    able
glances.

"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by
wi    hdrawing. We are going     o     he Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would
prefer no         o be de    ained."

"Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfas    ?"

"He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."

"Holloa!" cried s    a    ionary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a
few paces.

"Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."

Bu     he s    ole up     o us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, said- "Did ye see any    hing looking like men going     owards
    ha     ship a while ago?"

S    ruck by     his plain ma        er-of-fac     ques    ion, I answered, saying,
"Yes, I     hough     I did see four or five men; bu     i     was     oo dim     o be
sure."

"Very dim, very dim," said Elijah. "Morning     o ye."

Once more we qui        ed him; bu     once more he came sof    ly af    er us; and
    ouching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find 'em now, will
ye?

"Find who?"

"Morning     o ye! morning     o ye!" he rejoined, again moving off. "Oh! I
was going     o warn ye agains    - bu     never mind, never mind- i    's all
one, all in     he family     oo;- sharp fros         his morning, ain'     i    ?
Good-bye     o ye. Shan'     see ye again very soon, I guess; unless i    's
before     he Grand Jury." And wi    h     hese cracked words he finally
depar    ed, leaving me, for     he momen    , in no small wondermen     a     his
fran    ic impudence.

A     las    , s    epping on board     he Pequod, we found every    hing in
profound quie    , no     a soul moving. The cabin en    rance was locked
wi    hin;     he ha    ches were all on, and lumbered wi    h coils of
rigging. Going forward     o     he forecas    le, we found     he slide of     he
scu        le open. Seeing a ligh    , we wen     down, and found only an old
rigger     here, wrapped in a     a        ered pea-jacke    . He was     hrown a    
whole leng    h upon     wo ches    s, his face downwards and inclosed in his
folded arms. The profoundes     slumber slep     upon him.

"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can     hey have gone     o?" said
I, looking dubiously a         he sleeper. Bu     i     seemed     ha    , when on     he
wharf, Queequeg had no     a     all no    iced wha     I now alluded     o; hence I
would have     hough     myself     o have been op    ically deceived in     ha    
ma        er, were i     no     for Elijah's o    herwise inexplicable ques    ion. Bu    
I bea         he     hing down; and again marking     he sleeper, jocularly
hin    ed     o Queequeg     ha     perhaps we had bes     si     up wi    h     he body;
    elling him     o es    ablish himself accordingly. He pu     his hand upon
    he sleeper's rear, as     hough feeling if i     was sof     enough; and
    hen, wi    hou     more ado, sa     quie    ly down     here.

"Gracious! Queequeg, don'     si         here," said I.

"Oh; perry dood sea    ," said Queequeg, "my coun    ry way; won'     hur     him
face."

"Face!" said I, "call     ha     his face? very benevolen     coun    enance
    hen; bu     how hard he brea    hes, he's heaving himself; ge     off,
Queequeg, you are heavy, i    's grinding     he face of     he poor. Ge     off,
Queequeg! Look, he'll     wi    ch you off soon. I wonder he don'     wake."

Queequeg removed himself     o jus     beyond     he head of     he sleeper, and
ligh    ed his     omahawk pipe. I sa     a         he fee    . We kep         he pipe
passing over     he sleeper, from one     o     he o    her. Meanwhile, upon
ques    ioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me     o unders    and
    ha    , in his land, owing     o     he absence of se        ees and sofas of all
sor    s,     he king, chiefs, and grea     people generally, were in     he
cus    om of fa        ening some of     he lower orders for o        omans; and     o
furnish a house comfor    ably in     ha     respec    , you had only     o buy up
eigh     or     en lazy fellows, and lay     hem around in     he piers and
alcoves.  Besides, i     was very convenien     on an excursion; much
be        er     han     hose garden-chairs which are conver    ible in    o walking
s    icks; upon occasion, a chief calling his a        endan    , and desiring
him     o make a se        ee of himself under a spreading     ree, perhaps in
some damp marshy place.

While narra    ing     hese     hings, every     ime Queequeg received     he
    omahawk from me, he flourished     he ha    che    -side of i     over     he
sleeper's head.

"Wha    's     ha     for, Queequeg?"

"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!

He was going on wi    h some wild reminiscences abou     his     omahawk-pipe
which, i     seemed, had in i    s     wo uses bo    h brained his foes and
soo    hed his soul, when we were direc    ly a        rac    ed     o     he sleeping
rigger. The s    rong vapor now comple    ely filling     he con    rac    ed hole,
i     began     o     ell upon him. He brea    hed wi    h a sor     of muffledness;
    hen seemed     roubled in     he nose;     hen revolved over once or     wice;
    hen sa     up and rubbed his eyes.

"Holloa!" he brea    hed a     las    , "who be ye smokers?"

"Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"

"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails     o-day. The Cap    ain
came aboard las     nigh    ."

"Wha     Cap    ain?- Ahab?"

"Who bu     him indeed?"

I was going     o ask him some fur    her ques    ions concerning Ahab, when
we heard a noise on deck.

"Holloa! S    arbuck's as    ir," said     he rigger. "He's a lively chief
ma    e     ha    ; good man, and a pious; bu     all alive now, I mus         urn     o."
And so saying he wen     on deck, and we followed.

I     was now clear sunrise. Soon     he crew came on board in     wos and
    hrees;     he riggers bes    irred     hemselves;     he ma    es were ac    ively
engaged; and several of     he shore people were busy in bringing
various las         hings on board. Meanwhile Cap    ain Ahab remained
invisibly enshrined wi    hin his cabin.




Merry Chris    mas


A     leng    h,     owards noon, upon     he final dismissal of     he ship's
riggers, and af    er     he Pequod had been hauled ou     from     he wharf, and
af    er     he ever-    hough    ful Chari    y had come off in a whale-boa    , wi    h
her las     gif    - a nigh    cap for S    ubb,     he second ma    e, her
bro    her-in-law, and a spare Bible for     he s    eward- af    er all     his,
    he     wo Cap    ains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from     he cabin, and
    urning     o     he chief ma    e, Peleg said:

"Now, Mr. S    arbuck, are you sure every    hing is righ    ? Cap    ain Ahab is
all ready- jus     spoke     o him- no    hing more     o be go     from shore, eh?
Well, call all hands,     hen.  Mus    er 'em af     here- blas     'em!"

"No need of profane words, however grea         he hurry, Peleg," said
Bildad, "bu     away wi    h     hee, friend S    arbuck, and do our bidding."

How now! Here upon     he very poin     of s    ar    ing for     he voyage, Cap    ain
Peleg and Cap    ain Bildad were going i     wi    h a high hand on     he
quar    er-deck, jus     as if     hey were     o be join    -commanders a     sea, as
well as     o all appearances in por    . And, as for Cap    ain Ahab, no sign
of him was ye         o be seen; only,     hey said he was in     he cabin. Bu    
    hen,     he idea was,     ha     his presence was by no means necessary in
ge        ing     he ship under weigh, and s    eering her well ou         o
sea. Indeed, as     ha     was no     a     all his proper business, bu         he
pilo    's; and as he was no     ye     comple    ely recovered- so     hey said-
    herefore, Cap    ain Ahab s    ayed below. And all     his seemed na    ural
enough; especially as in     he merchan     service many cap    ains never
show     hemselves on deck for a considerable     ime af    er heaving up     he
anchor, bu     remain over     he cabin     able, having a farewell
merry-making wi    h     heir shore friends, before     hey qui         he ship for
good wi    h     he pilo    .

Bu         here was no     much chance     o     hink over     he ma        er, for Cap    ain
Peleg was now all alive. He seemed     o do mos     of     he     alking and
commanding, and no     Bildad.

"Af     here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as     he sailors lingered
a         he main-mas    . "Mr. S    arbuck, drive af    ."

"S    rike     he     en         here!"- was     he nex     order. As I hin    ed before,
    his whalebone marquee was never pi    ched excep     in por    ; and on board
    he Pequod, for     hir    y years,     he order     o s    rike     he     en     was well
known     o be     he nex         hing     o heaving up     he anchor.

"Man     he caps    an! Blood and     hunder!- jump!"- was     he nex     command,
and     he crew sprang for     he handspikes.

Now in ge        ing under weigh,     he s    a    ion generally occupied by     he
pilo     is     he forward par     of     he ship. And here Bildad, who, wi    h
Peleg, be i     known, in addi    ion     o his o    her officers, was one of     he
licensed pilo    s of     he por    - he being suspec    ed     o have go     himself
made a pilo     in order     o save     he Nan    ucke     pilo    -fee     o all     he
ships he was concerned in, for he never pilo    ed any o    her craf    -
Bildad, I say, migh     now be seen ac    ively engaged in looking over     he
bows for     he approaching anchor, and a     in    ervals singing wha     seemed
a dismal s    ave of psalmody,     o cheer     he hands a         he windlass, who
roared for    h some sor     of chorus abou         he girls in Booble Alley,
wi    h hear    y good will.  Never    heless, no         hree days previous, Bildad
had     old     hem     ha     no profane songs would be allowed on board     he
Pequod, par    icularly in ge        ing under weigh; and Chari    y, his sis    er,
had placed a small choice copy of Wa        s in each seaman's ber    h.

Mean    ime, overseeing     he o    her par     of     he ship, Cap    ain Peleg ripped
and swore as    ern in     he mos     frigh    ful manner. I almos         hough     he
would sink     he ship before     he anchor could be go     up; involun    arily
I paused on my handspike, and     old Queequeg     o do     he same,     hinking
of     he perils we bo    h ran, in s    ar    ing on     he voyage wi    h such a
devil for a pilo    . I was comfor    ing myself, however, wi    h     he     hough    
    ha     in pious Bildad migh     be found some salva    ion, spi    e of his
seven hundred and seven    y-seven    h lay; when I fel     a sudden sharp
poke in my rear, and     urning round, was horrified a         he appari    ion
of Cap    ain Peleg in     he ar     of wi    hdrawing his leg from my immedia    e
vicini    y. Tha     was my firs     kick.

"Is     ha         he way     hey heave in     he marchan     service?" he roared.
"Spring,     hou sheep-head; spring, and break     hy backbone! Why don'    
ye spring, I say, all of ye- spring! Quohog! spring,     hou chap wi    h
    he red whiskers; spring     here, Sco    ch-cap; spring,     hou green
pan    s. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes ou    !" And so
saying, he moved along     he windlass, here and     here using his leg
very freely, while imper    urbable Bildad kep     leading off wi    h his
psalmody. Thinks I, Cap    ain Peleg mus     have been drinking some    hing
    o-day.

A     las         he anchor was up,     he sails were se    , and off we glided. I    
was a shor    , cold Chris    mas; and as     he shor     nor    hern day merged
in    o nigh    , we found ourselves almos     broad upon     he win    ry ocean,
whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long
rows of     ee    h on     he bulwarks glis    ened in     he moonligh    ; and like
    he whi    e ivory     usks of some huge elephan    , vas     curving icicles
depended from     he bows.

Lank Bildad, as pilo    , headed     he firs     wa    ch, and ever and anon, as
    he old craf     deep dived in    o     he green seas, and sen         he shivering
fros     all over her, and     he winds howled, and     he cordage rang, his
s    eady no    es were heard,-

              "Swee     fields beyond     he swelling flood,
                   S    and dressed in living green.
                  So     o     he Jews old Canaan s    ood,
                    While Jordan rolled be    ween."

Never did     hose swee     words sound more swee    ly     o me     han     hen. They
were full of hope and frui    ion. Spi    e of     his frigid win    er nigh     in
    he bois    erous A    lan    ic, spi    e of my we     fee     and we        er jacke    ,
    here was ye    , i         hen seemed     o me, many a pleasan     haven in s    ore;
and meads and glades so e    ernally vernal,     ha         he grass sho     up by
    he spring, un    rodden, unwil    ed, remains a     midsummer.

A     las     we gained such an offing,     ha         he     wo pilo    s were needed no
longer. The s    ou     sail-boa         ha     had accompanied us began ranging
alongside.

I     was curious and no     unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affec    ed
a         his junc    ure, especially Cap    ain Bildad. For loa    h     o depar    ,
ye    ; very loa    h     o leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and
perilous a voyage- beyond bo    h s    ormy Capes; a ship in which some
    housands of his hardearned dollars were inves    ed; a ship, in which
an old shipma    e sailed as cap    ain; a man almos     as old as he, once
more s    ar    ing     o encoun    er all     he     errors of     he pi    iless jaw; loa    h
    o say good-bye     o a     hing so every way brimful of every in    eres         o
him,- poor old Bildad lingered long; paced     he deck wi    h anxious
s    rides; ran down in    o     he cabin     o speak ano    her farewell word
    here; again came on deck, and looked     o windward; looked     owards     he
wide and endless wa    ers, only bound by     he far-off unseen Eas    ern
Con    inen    s; looked     owards     he land; looked alof    ; looked righ     and
lef    ; looked everywhere and nowhere; and a     las    , mechanically
coiling a rope upon i    s pin, convulsively grasped s    ou     Peleg by     he
hand, and holding up a lan    ern, for a momen     s    ood gazing heroically
in his face, as much as     o say, "Never    heless, friend Peleg, I can
s    and i    ; yes, I can."

As for Peleg himself, he     ook i     more like a philosopher; bu     for all
his philosophy,     here was a     ear     winkling in his eye, when     he
lan    ern came     oo near. And he,     oo, did no     a li        le run from     he
cabin     o deck- now a word below, and now a word wi    h S    arbuck,     he
chief ma    e.

Bu    , a     las    , he     urned     o his comrade, wi    h a final sor     of look
abou     him,- "Cap    ain Bildad- come, old shipma    e, we mus     go. Back     he
mainyard     here! Boa     ahoy!  S    and by     o come close alongside, now!
Careful, careful!- come, Bildad, boy- say your las    . Luck     o ye,

good luck     o ye all- and     his day     hree years I'll have a ho     supper
smoking for ye in old Nan    ucke    . Hurrah and away!"

"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old
Bildad, almos     incoheren    ly. "I hope ye'll have fine wea    her now, so
    ha     Cap    ain Ahab may soon be moving among ye- a pleasan     sun is all

"Come, come, Cap    ain Bildad; s    op palavering,- away!" and wi    h     ha    ,
Peleg hurried him over     he side, and bo    h drop     in    o     he boa    .

Ship and boa     diverged;     he cold, damp nigh     breeze blew be    ween; a

    hree heavy-hear    ed cheers, and blindly plunged like fa    e in    o     he

The Lee Shore


Some chap    ers back, one Bulking    on was spoken of, a     all, newlanded
mariner, encoun    ered in New Bedford a         he inn.

When on     ha     shivering win    er's nigh    ,     he Pequod     hrus     her

s    anding a     her helm bu     Bulking    on! I looked wi    h sympa    he    ic awe
and fearfulness upon     he man, who in mid-win    er jus     landed from a
four years' dangerous voyage, could so unres    ingly push off again for

yield no epi    aphs;     his six-inch chap    er is     he s    oneless grave of
Bulking    on. Le     me only say     ha     i     fared wi    h him as wi    h     he

The Advoca    e


As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in     his business of
whaling; and as     his business of whaling has somehow come     o be
regarded among landsmen as a ra    her unpoe    ical and disrepu    able
pursui    ;     herefore, I am all anxie    y     o convince ye, ye landsmen, of
    he injus    ice hereby done     o us hun    ers of whales.

In     he firs     place, i     may be deemed almos     superfluous     o es    ablish
    he fac    ,     ha     among people a     large,     he business of whaling is no    
accoun    ed on a level wi    h wha     are called     he liberal professions. If
a s    ranger were in    roduced in    o any miscellaneous me    ropoli    an
socie    y, i     would bu     sligh    ly advance     he general opinion of his
meri    s, were he presen    ed     o     he company as a harpooneer, say; and if
in emula    ion of     he naval officers he should append     he ini    ials
S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery)     o his vis    ing card, such a procedure
would be deemed preeminen    ly presuming and ridiculous.

Doub    less one leading reason why     he world declines honoring us
whalemen, is     his:     hey     hink     ha    , a     bes    , our voca    ion amoun    s     o
a bu    chering sor     of business; and     ha     when ac    ively engaged
    herein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilemen    s. Bu    chers we

badge have been all Mar    ial Commanders whom     he world invariably
deligh    s     o honor. And as for     he ma        er of     he alleged uncleanliness
of our business, ye shall soon be ini    ia    ed in    o cer    ain fac    s

Why did     he Du    ch in De Wi        's     ime have admirals of     heir whaling

Bu         his is no         he half; look again.

Un    il     he whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce bu     colonial,

Bu     if, in     he face of all     his, you s    ill declare     ha     whaling has

The whale has no famous au    hor, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
will say.

The whale no famous au    hor, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who

True enough, bu         hen whalemen     hemselves are poor devils;     hey have

No good blood in     heir veins? They have some    hing be        er     han royal

Good again; bu         hen all confess     ha     somehow whaling is no    
respec    able.

Whaling no     respec    able? Whaling is imperial! By old English
s    a    u    ory law,     he whale is declared "a royal fish."

Oh,     ha    's only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any
grand imposing way.

The whale never figured in any grand imposing way? In one of     he

Gran     i    , since you ci    e i    ; bu     say wha     you will,     here is no real

Pos    scrip    


In behalf of     he digni    y of whaling, I would fain advance naugh     bu    
subs    an    ia    ed fac    s. Bu     af    er emba        ling his fac    s, an advoca    e who
should wholly suppress a no     unreasonable surmise, which migh         ell
eloquen    ly upon his cause- such an advoca    e, would he no     be
blame-wor    hy?

I     is well known     ha     a         he corona    ion of kings and queens, even
modern ones, a cer    ain curious process of seasoning     hem for     heir
func    ions is gone     hrough. There is a sal    cellar of s    a    e, so called,
and     here may be a cas    or of s    a    e. How     hey use     he sal    , precisely-
who knows? Cer    ain I am, however,     ha     a king's head is solemnly
oiled a     his corona    ion, even as a head of salad. Can i     be,     hough,
    ha         hey anoin     i     wi    h a view of making i    s in    erior run well, as
    hey anoin     machinery? Much migh     be rumina    ed here, concerning     he
essen    ial digni    y of     his regal process, because in common life we
es    eem bu     meanly and con    emp    ibly a fellow who anoin    s his hair, and
palpably smells of     ha     anoin    ing. In     ru    h, a ma    ure man who uses
hairoil, unless medicinally,     ha     man has probably go     a quoggy spo    
in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can'     amoun         o much in his
    o    ali    y.

Bu         he only     hing     o be considered here is     his- wha     kind of oil is
used a     corona    ions? Cer    ainly i     canno     be olive oil, nor macassar
oil, nor cas    or oil, nor bear's oil, nor     rain oil, nor cod-liver
oil. Wha         hen can i     possibly be, bu         he sperm oil in i    s
unmanufac    ured, unpollu    ed s    a    e,     he swee    es     of all oils?

Knigh    s and Squires


The chief ma    e of     he Pequod was S    arbuck, a na    ive of Nan    ucke    , and
a Quaker by descen    . He was a long, earnes     man, and     hough born on
an icy coas    , seemed well adap    ed     o endure ho     la    i    udes, his flesh
being hard as     wice-baked biscui    . Transpor    ed     o     he Indies, his
live blood would no     spoil like bo        led ale. He mus     have been born
in some     ime of general drough     and famine, or upon one of     hose fas    
days for which his s    a    e is famous. Only some     hir    y and summers had
he seen;     hose summers had dried up all his physical
superfluousness. Bu         his, his     hinness, so     o speak, seemed no more
    he     oken of was    ing anxie    ies and cares,     han i     seemed     he
indica    ion of any bodily bligh    . I     was merely     he condensa    ion of
    he man. He was by no means ill-looking; qui    e     he con    rary.  His
pure     igh     skin was an excellen     fi    ; and closely wrapped up in i    ,
and embalmed wi    h inner heal    h and s    reng    h, like a revivified
Egyp    ian,     his S    arbuck seemed prepared     o endure for long ages     o
come, and     o endure always, as now; for be i     Polar snow or     orrid
sun, like a pa    en     chronome    er, his in    erior vi    ali    y was warran    ed
    o do well in all clima    es. Looking in    o his eves, you seemed     o see
    here     he ye     lingering images of     hose     housand-fold perils he had
calmly confron    ed     hrough life. A s    aid, s    eadfas     man, whose life
for     he mos     par     was a     elling pan    omime of ac    ion, and no     a     ame
chap    er of sounds. Ye    , for all his hardy sobrie    y and for    i    ude,
    here were cer    ain quali    ies in him which a         imes affec    ed, and in
some cases seemed well nigh     o overbalance all     he res    .  Uncommonly
conscien    ious for a seaman, and endued wi    h a deep na    ural reverence,
    he wild wa    ery loneliness of his life did     herefore s    rongly incline
him     o supers    i    ion; bu         o     ha     sor     of supers    i    ion, which in some
organiza    ion seems ra    her     o spring, somehow, from in    elligence     han
from ignorance. Ou    ward por    en    s and inward presen    imen    s were his.
And if a         imes     hese     hings ben         he welded iron of his soul, much
more did his far-away domes    ic memories of his young Cape wife and
child,     end     o bend him s    ill more from     he original ruggedness of
his na    ure, and open him s    ill fur    her     o     hose la    en     influences
which, in some hones    -hear    ed men, res    rain     he gush of dare-devil
daring, so of    en evinced by o    hers in     he more perilous vicissi    udes
of     he fishery. "I will have no man in my boa    ," said S    arbuck, "who
is no     afraid of a whale." By     his, he seemed     o mean, no     only     ha    
    he mos     reliable and useful courage was     ha     which arises from     he
fair es    ima    ion of     he encoun    ered peril, bu         ha     an u        erly
fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade     han a coward.

"Aye, aye," said S    ubb,     he second ma    e, "S    arbuck,     here, is as
careful a man as you'll find anywhere in     his fishery." Bu     we shall
ere long see wha         ha     word "careful" precisely means when used by a
man like S    ubb, or almos     any o    her whale hun    er.

S    arbuck was no crusader af    er perils; in him courage was no     a
sen    imen    ; bu     a     hing simply useful     o him, and always a     hand upon
all mor    ally prac    ical occasions. Besides, he     hough    , perhaps,     ha    
in     his business of whaling, courage was one of     he grea     s    aple
ou    fi    s of     he ship, like her beef and her bread, and no         o be
foolishly was    ed.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales
af    er sun-down; nor for persis    ing in figh    ing a fish     ha         oo much
persis    ed in figh    ing him. For,     hough     S    arbuck, I am here in     his
cri    ical ocean     o kill whales for my living, and no         o be killed by
    hem for     heirs; and     ha     hundreds of men had been so killed S    arbuck
well knew. Wha     doom was his own fa    her's? Where, in     he bo        omless
deeps, could he find     he     orn limbs of his bro    her?

Wi    h memories like     hese in him, and, moreover, given     o a cer    ain
supers    i    iousness, as has been said;     he courage of     his S    arbuck,
which could, never    heless, s    ill flourish, mus     indeed have been
ex    reme. Bu     i     was no     in reasonable na    ure     ha     a man so organized,
and wi    h such     errible experiences and remembrances as he had; i     was
no     in na    ure     ha         hese     hings should fail in la    en    ly engendering
an elemen     in him, which, under sui    able circums    ances, would break
ou     from i    s confinemen    , and burn all his courage up. And brave as
he migh     be, i     was     ha     sor     of bravery chiefly, visible in some
in    repid men, which, while generally abiding firm in     he conflic    
wi    h seas, or winds, or whales, or any of     he ordinary irra    ional
horrors of     he world, ye     canno     wi    hs    and     hose more     errific,
because more spiri    ual     errors, which some    imes menace you from     he
concen    ra    ing brow of an enraged and migh    y man.

Bu     were     he coming narra    ive     o reveal in any ins    ance,     he comple    e
abasemen     of poor S    arbuck's for    i    ude, scarce migh     I have     he hear

may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; bu    , man, in     he ideal,

Knigh    s and Squires


S    ubb was     he second ma    e. He was a na    ive of Cape Cod; and hence,
according     o local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A
happy-go-lucky; nei    her craven nor valian    ;     aking perils as     hey
came wi    h an indifferen     air; and while engaged in     he mos     imminen    
crisis of     he chase,     oiling away, calm and collec    ed as a journeyman
joiner engaged for     he year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he
presided over his whaleboa     as if     he mos     deadly encoun    er were bu    
a dinner, and his crew all invi    ed gues    s. He was as par    icular abou    
    he comfor    able arrangemen    s of his par     of     he boa    , as an old
s    age-driver is abou         he snugness of his box. When close     o     he
whale, in     he very dea    h-lock of     he figh    , he handled his unpi    ying
lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whis    ling     inker his hammer. He
would hum over his old rigadig     unes while flank and flank wi    h     he
mos     exaspera    ed mons    er. Long usage had, for     his S    ubb, conver    ed
    he jaws of dea    h in    o an easy chair. Wha     he     hough     of dea    h
i    self,     here is no     elling. Whe    her he ever     hough     of i     a     all,
migh     be a ques    ion; bu    , if he ever did chance     o cas     his mind     ha    
way af    er a comfor    able dinner, no doub    , like a good sailor, he     ook
i         o be a sor     of call of     he wa    ch     o     umble alof    , and bes    ir
    hemselves     here, abou     some    hing which he would find ou     when he
obeyed     he order, and no     sooner.

Wha    , perhaps, wi    h o    her     hings, made S    ubb such an easy-going,
unfearing man, so cheerily     rudging off wi    h     he burden of life in a
world fail of grave peddlers, all bowed     o     he ground wi    h     heir
packs; wha     helped     o bring abou         ha     almos     impious good-humor of
his;     ha         hing mus     have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his
shor    , black li        le pipe was one of     he regular fea    ures of his
face. You would almos     as soon have expec    ed him     o     urn ou     of his
bunk wi    hou     his nose as wi    hou     his pipe. He kep     a whole row of
pipes     here ready loaded, s    uck in a rack, wi    hin easy reach of his
hand; and, whenever he     urned in, he smoked     hem all ou     in
succession, ligh    ing one from     he o    her     o     he end of     he chap    er;
    hen loading     hem again     o be in readiness anew. For, when S    ubb
dressed, ins    ead of firs     pu        ing his legs in    o his     rowsers, he pu    
his pipe in    o his mou    h.

I say     his con    inual smoking mus     have been one cause, a     leas     of
his peculiar disposi    ion; for every one knows     ha         his early air,
whe    her ashore or afloa    , is     erribly infec    ed wi    h     he nameless
miseries of     he numberless mor    als who have died exhaling i    ; and as
in     ime of     he cholera, some people go abou     wi    h a camphora    ed
handkerchief     o     heir mou    hs; so, likewise, agains     all mor    al
    ribula    ions, S    ubb's     obacco smoke migh     have opera    ed as a sor     of
disinfec    ing agen    .

The     hird ma    e was Flask, a na    ive of Tisbury, in Mar    ha's
Vineyard. A shor    , s    ou    , ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious
concerning whales, who somehow seemed     o     hink     ha         he grea    
Levia    hans had personally and heredi    arily affron    ed him; and
    herefore i     was a sor     of poin     of honor wi    h him,     o des    roy     hem
whenever encoun    ered. So u        erly los     was he     o all sense of
reverence for     he many marvels of     heir majes    ic bulk and mys    ic
ways; and so dead     o any    hing like an apprehension of any possible
danger encoun    ering     hem;     ha     in his poor opinion,     he wondrous
whale was bu     a species of magnified mouse, or a     leas     wa    er-ra    ,
requiring only a li        le circumven    ion and some small applica    ion of
    ime and     rouble in order     o kill and boil. This ignoran    ,
unconscious fearlessness of his made him a li        le waggish in     he
ma        er of whales; he followed     hese fish for     he fun of i    ; and a
    hree years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke     ha     las    ed
    ha     leng    h of     ime. As a carpen    er's nails are divided in    o wrough    
nails and cu     nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Li        le
Flask was one of     he wrough     ones; made     o clinch     igh     and las    
long. They called him King-Pos     on board of     he Pequod; because, in
form, he could be well likened     o     he shor    , square     imber known by
    ha     name in Arc    ic whalers; and which by     he means of many radia    ing
side     imbers inser    ed in    o i    , serves     o brace     he ship agains         he
icy concussions of     hose ba        ering seas.

Now     hese     hree ma    es- S    arbuck, S    ubb and Flask, were momen    ous
men. They was who by universal prescrip    ion commanded     hree of     he
Pequod's boa    s as headsmen. In     ha     grand order of ba        le in which
Cap    ain Ahab would probably marshal his forces     o descend on     he
whales,     hese     hree headsmen were as cap    ains of companies. Or, being
armed wi    h     heir long keen whaling spears,     hey were as a picked     rio
of lancers; even as     he harpooneers were flingers of javelins.

And since in     his famous fishery, each ma    e or headsman, like a
Go    hic Knigh     of old, is always accompanied by his boa    -s    eerer or
harpooneer, who in cer    ain conjunc    ures provides him wi    h a fresh
lance, when     he former one has been badly     wis    ed, or elbowed in     he
assaul    ; and moreover, as     here generally subsis    s be    ween     he     wo, a
close in    imacy and friendliness; i     is     herefore bu     mee    ,     ha     in
    his place we se     down who     he Pequod's harpooneers were, and     o wha    
headsman each of     hem belonged.

Firs     of all was Queequeg, whom S    arbuck,     he chief ma    e, had
selec    ed for his squire.  Bu     Queequeg is already known.

Nex     was Tash    ego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head,     he mos     wes    erly
promon    ory of Mar    ha's Vineyard, where     here s    ill exis    s     he las    
remnan     of a village of red men, which has long supplied     he
neighboring island of Nan    ucke     wi    h many of her mos     daring
harpooneers. In     he fishery,     hey usually go by     he generic name of
Gay-Headers.  Tash    ego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek
bones, and black rounding eyes- for an Indian, Orien    al in     heir
largeness, bu     An    arc    ic in     heir gli        ering expression- all     his
sufficien    ly proclaimed him an inheri    or of     he unvi    ia    ed blood of
    hose proud warrior hun    ers, who, in ques     of     he grea     New England
moose, had scoured, bow in hand,     he aboriginal fores    s of     he
main. Bu     no longer snuffing in     he     rail of     he wild beas    s of     he
woodland, Tash    ego now hun    ed in     he wake of     he grea     whales of     he
sea;     he unerring harpoon of     he son fi    ly replacing     he infallible
arrow of     he sires. To look a         he     awny brawn of his li    he snaky
limbs, you would almos     have credi    ed     he supers    i    ions of some of
    he earlier Puri    ans and half-believed     his wild Indian     o be a son
of     he Prince of     he Powers of     he Air. Tash    ego was S    ubb     he second
ma    e's squire.

Third among     he harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigan    ic, coal-black
negro-savage, wi    h a lion-like     read- an Ahasuerus     o
behold. Suspended from his ears were     wo golden hoops, so large     ha    
    he sailors called     hem ringbol    s, and would     alk of securing     he
    op-sail halyards     o     hem. In his you    h Daggoo had volun    arily
shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his na    ive
coas    . And never having been anywhere in     he world bu     in Africa,
Nan    ucke    , and     he pagan harbors mos     frequen    ed by     he whalemen; and
having now led for many years     he bold life of     he fishery in     he
ships of owners uncommonly heedful of wha     manner of men     hey
shipped; Daggoo re    ained all his barbaric vir    ues, and erec     as a
giraffe, moved abou         he decks in all     he pomp of six fee     five in
his socks. There was a corporeal humili    y in looking up a     him; and a
whi    e man s    anding before him seemed a whi    e flag come     o beg     ruce
of a for    ress. Curious     o     ell,     his imperial negro, Ahasuerus
Daggoo, was     he Squire of li        le Flask, who looked like a chess-man
beside him.  As for     he residue of     he Pequod's company, be i     said,
    ha     a         he presen     day no     one in     wo of     he many     housand men
before     he mas     employed in     he American whale fishery, are Americans
born,     hough pre        y nearly all     he officers are. Herein i     is     he
same wi    h     he American whale fishery as wi    h     he American army and
mili    ary and merchan     navies, and     he engineering forces employed in
    he cons    ruc    ion of     he American Canals and Railroads. The same, I
say, because in all     hese cases     he na    ive American li    erally
provides     he brains,     he res     of     he world as generously supplying
    he muscles. No small number of     hese whaling seamen belong     o     he
Azores, where     he ou    ward bound Nan    ucke     whalers frequen    ly     ouch     o
augmen         heir crews from     he hardy peasan    s of     hose rocky shores. In
like manner,     he Greenland whalers sailing ou     of Hull or London, pu    
in a         he She    land Islands,     o receive     he full complemen     of     heir
crew. Upon     he passage homewards,     hey drop     hem     here again. How i    
is,     here is no     elling, bu     Islanders seem     o make     he bes    
whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in     he Pequod, Isola    oes

each Isola    o living on a separa    e con    inen     of his own. Ye     now,

Ahab


For several days af    er leaving Nan    ucke    , no    hing above ha    ches was
seen of Cap    ain Ahab. The ma    es regularly relieved each o    her a         he
wa    ches, and for augh         ha     could be seen     o     he con    rary,     hey
seemed     o be     he only commanders of     he ship; only     hey some    imes
issued from     he cabin wi    h orders so sudden and peremp    ory,     ha    
af    er all i     was plain     hey bu     commanded vicariously. Ye    ,     heir
supreme lord and dic    a    or was     here,     hough hi    her    o unseen by any
eyes no     permi        ed     o pene    ra    e in    o     he now sacred re    rea     of     he
cabin.

Every     ime I ascended     o     he deck from my wa    ches below, I ins    an    ly
gazed af         o mark if any s    range face was visible; for my firs     vague
disquie    ude     ouching     he unknown cap    ain, now in     he seclusion of     he
sea became almos     a per    urba    ion. This was s    rangely heigh    ened a    
    imes by     he ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvi    edly
recurring     o me, wi    h a sub    le energy I could no     have before
conceived of. Bu     poorly could I wi    hs    and     hem, much as in o    her
moods I was almos     ready     o smile a         he solemn whimsicali    ies of
    ha     ou    landish prophe     of     he wharves. Bu     wha    ever i     was of
apprehensiveness or uneasiness-     o call i     so- which I fel    , ye    
whenever I came     o look abou     me in     he ship, i     seemed agains     all
warran    y     o cherish such emo    ions. For     hough     he harpooneers, wi    h
    he grea     body of     he crew, were a far more barbaric, hea    henish, and
mo    ley se         han any of     he     ame merchan    -ship companies which my
previous experiences had made me acquain    ed wi    h, s    ill I ascribed
    his- and righ    ly ascribed i    -     o     he fierce uniqueness of     he very
na    ure of     ha     wild Scandinavian voca    ion in which I had so
abandonedly embarked. Bu     i     was especially     he aspec     of     he     hree
chief officers of     he ship,     he ma    es, which was mos     forcibly
calcula    ed     o allay     hese colorless misgivings, and induce confidence
and cheerfulness in every presen    men     of     he voyage. Three be        er,
more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own differen     way,
could no     readily be found, and     hey were every one of     hem
Americans; a Nan    ucke    er, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, i     being
Chris    mas when     he ship sho     from ou     her harbor, for a space we had
bi    ing Polar wea    her,     hough all     he     ime running away from i         o     he

sailed, gradually leaving     ha     merciless win    er, and all i    s
in    olerable wea    her behind us. I     was one of     hose less lowering, bu    
s    ill grey and gloomy enough mornings of     he     ransi    ion, when wi    h a
fair wind     he ship was rushing     hrough     he wa    er wi    h a vindic    ive
sor     of leaping and melancholy rapidi    y,     ha     as I moun    ed     o     he
deck a         he call of     he forenoon wa    ch, so soon as I levelled my
glance     owards     he     affrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reali    y
ou    ran apprehension; Cap    ain Ahab s    ood upon his quar    er-deck.

There seemed no sign of common bodily illness abou     him, nor of     he
recovery from any.  He looked like a man cu     away from     he s    ake,
when     he fire has overrunningly was    ed all     he limbs wi    hou    
consuming     hem, or     aking away one par    icle from     heir compac    ed aged
robus    ness. His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,
and shaped in an unal    erable mould, like Cellini's cas    
Perseus. Threading i    s way ou     from among his grey hairs, and
con    inuing righ     down one side of his     awny scorched face and neck,
    ill i     disappeared in his clo    hing, you saw a slender rod-like mark,
lividly whi    ish. I     resembled     ha     perpendicular seam some    imes made
in     he s    raigh    , lof    y     runk of a grea         ree, when     he upper
ligh    ning     earingly dar    s down i    , and wi    hou     wrenching a single
    wig, peels and grooves ou         he bark from     op     o bo        om ere running
off in    o     he soil, leaving     he     ree s    ill greenly alive, bu    
branded. Whe    her     ha     mark was born wi    h him, or whe    her i     was     he
scar lef     by some despera    e wound, no one could cer    ainly say. By
some     aci     consen    ,     hroughou         he voyage li        le or no allusion was
made     o i    , especially by     he ma    es. Bu     once Tash    ego's senior, an
old Gay-Head Indian among     he crew, supers    i    iously asser    ed     ha     no    
    ill he was full for    y years old did Ahab become     ha     way branded,
and     hen i     came upon him, no     in     he fury of any mor    al fray, bu     in
an elemen    al s    rife a     sea. Ye    ,     his wild hin     seemed inferen    ially
nega    ived, by wha     a grey Manxman insinua    ed, an old sepulchral man,
who, having never before sailed ou     of Nan    ucke    , had never ere     his
laid eye upon wild Ahab. Never    heless,     he old sea-    radi    ions,     he
immemorial creduli    ies, popularly inves    ed     his old Manxman wi    h
pre    erna    ural powers of discernmen    . So     ha     no whi    e sailor
seriously con    radic    ed him when he said     ha     if ever Cap    ain Ahab
should be     ranquilly laid ou    - which migh     hardly come     o pass, so he
mu        ered-     hen, whoever should do     ha     las     office for     he dead,
would find a bir    h-mark on him from crown     o sole.

So powerfully did     he whole grim aspec     of Ahab affec     me, and     he
livid brand which s    reaked i    ,     ha     for     he firs     few momen    s I
hardly no    ed     ha     no     a li        le of     his overbearing grimness was owing
    o     he barbaric whi    e leg upon which he par    ly s    ood. I     had
previously come     o me     ha         his ivory leg had a     sea been fashioned
from     he polished bone of     he sperm whale's jaw. "Aye, he was
dismas    ed off Japan," said     he old Gay-Head Indian once; "bu     like
his dismas    ed craf    , he shipped ano    her mas     wi    hou     coming home for
i    . He has a quiver of 'em."

I was s    ruck wi    h     he singular pos    ure he main    ained. Upon each side
of     he Pequod's quar    er deck, and pre        y close     o     he mizzen shrouds,
    here was an auger hole, bored abou     half an inch or so, in    o     he
plank. His bone leg s    eadied in     ha     hole; one arm eleva    ed, and
holding by a shroud; Cap    ain Ahab s    ood erec    , looking s    raigh     ou    
beyond     he ship's ever-pi    ching prow. There was an infini    y of
firmes     for    i    ude, a de    ermina    e, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in     he
fixed and fearless, forward dedica    ion of     ha     glance.  No     a word he
spoke; nor did his officers say augh         o him;     hough by all     heir
minu    es     ges    ures and expressions,     hey plainly showed     he uneasy, if
no     painful, consciousness of being under a     roubled mas    er-eye. And
no     only     ha    , bu     moody s    ricken Ahab s    ood before     hem wi    h a
crucifixion in his face; in all     he nameless regal overbearing
digni    y of some migh    y woe.

Ere long, from his firs     visi     in     he air, he wi    hdrew in    o his
cabin. Bu     af    er     ha     morning, he was every day visible     o     he crew;
ei    her s    anding in his pivo    -hole, or sea    ed upon an ivory s    ool he
had; or heavily walking     he deck. As     he sky grew less gloomy;
indeed, began     o grow a li        le genial, he became s    ill less and less
a recluse; as if, when     he ship had sailed from home, no    hing bu         he
dead win    ry bleakness of     he sea had     hen kep     him so secluded. And,
by and by, i     came     o pass,     ha     he was almos     con    inually in     he
air; bu    , as ye    , for all     ha     he said, or percep    ibly did, on     he a    
las     sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary     here as ano    her mas    . Bu    
    he Pequod was only making a passage now; no     regularly cruising;
nearly all whaling prepara    ives needing supervision     he ma    es were
fully compe    en         o, so     ha         here was li        le or no    hing, ou     of
himself,     o employ or exci    e Ahab, now; and     hus chase away, for     ha    
one in    erval,     he clouds     ha     layer upon layer were piled upon his
brow, as ever all clouds choose     he lof    ies     peaks     o pile     hemselves
upon.

Never    heless, ere long,     he warm, warbling persuasiveness of     he
pleasan    , holiday wea    her we came     o, seemed gradually     o charm him
from his mood. For, as when     he red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and
May,     rip home     o     he win    ry, misan    hropic woods; even     he bares    ,
ruggedes    , mos         hunder-cloven old oak will a     leas     send for    h some
few green sprou    s,     o welcome such gladhear    ed visi    an    s; so Ahab
did, in     he end, a li        le respond     o     he playful allurings of     ha    
girlish air. More     han once did he pu     for    h     he fain     blossom of a
look, which, in any o    her man, would have soon flowered ou     in a
smile.




En    er Ahab;     o Him, S    ubb


Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all as    ern,     he Pequod now
wen     rolling     hrough     he brigh     Qui    o spring, which a     sea, almos    
perpe    ually reigns on     he     hreshold of     he e    ernal Augus     of     he
Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing perfumed, overflowing,
redundan     days, were as crys    al goble    s of Persian sherbe    , heaped
up- flaked up, wi    h rose-wa    er snow. The s    arred and s    a    ely nigh    s
seemed haugh    y dames in jewelled velve    s, nursing a     home in lonely
pride,     he memory of     heir absen     conquering Earls,     he golden
helme    ed suns! For sleeping man, '    was hard     o choose be    ween such
winsome days and such seducing nigh    s. Bu     all     he wi    cheries of     ha    
unwaning wea    her did no     merely lend new spells and po    encies     o     he
ou    ward world. Inward     hey     urned upon     he soul, especially when     he
s    ill mild hours of eve came on;     hen, memory sho     her crys    als as
    he clear ice mos     forms of noiseless     wiligh    s. And all     hese sub    le
agencies, more and more     hey wrough     on Ahab's     ex    ure.

Old age is always wakeful; as if,     he longer linked wi    h life,     he
less man has     o do wi    h augh         ha     looks like dea    h. Among
sea-commanders,     he old greybeards will of    enes     leave     heir ber    hs
    o visi         he nigh    -cloaked deck. I     was so wi    h Ahab; only     ha     now,
of la    e, he seemed so much     o live in     he open air,     ha         ruly
speaking, his visi    s were more     o     he cabin,     han from     he cabin     o
    he planks. "I     feels like going down in    o one's     omb,"- he would
mu        er     o himself- "for an old cap    ain like me     o be descending     his
narrow scu        le,     o go     o my grave-dug ber    h."

So, almos     every     wen    y-four hours, when     he wa    ches of     he nigh    
were se    , and     he band on deck sen    inelled     he slumbers of     he band
below; and when if a rope was     o be hauled upon     he forecas    le,     he
sailors flung i     no     rudely down, as by day, bu     wi    h some
cau    iousness drop     i         o i    s place for fear of dis    urbing     heir
slumbering shipma    es; when     his sor     of s    eady quie    ude would begin
    o prevail, habi    ually,     he silen     s    eersman would wa    ch     he
cabin-scu        le; and ere long     he old man would emerge, gripping a         he
iron banis    er,     o help his crippled way. Some considering     ouch of
humani    y was in him; for a         imes like     hese, he usually abs    ained
from pa    rolling     he quar    er-deck; because     o his wearied ma    es,
seeking repose wi    hin six inches of his ivory heel, such would have
been     he reverbera    ing crack and din of     ha     bony s    ep,     ha         heir
dreams would have been on     he crunching     ee    h of sharks. Bu     once,
    he mood was on him     oo deep for common regardings; and as wi    h
heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring     he ship from     affrail     o
mainmas    , S    ubb,     he old second ma    e, came up from below, wi    h a
cer    ain unassured, depreca    ing humorousness, hin    ed     ha     if Cap    ain
Ahab was pleased     o walk     he planks,     hen, no one could say nay; bu    
    here migh     be some way of muffling     he noise; hin    ing some    hing
indis    inc    ly and hesi    a    ingly abou     a globe of     ow, and     he inser    ion
in    o i    , of     he ivory heel. Ah! S    ubb,     hou dids     no     know Ahab     hen.

"Am I a cannon-ball, S    ubb," said Ahab, "    ha         hou woulds     wad me
    ha     fashion? Bu     go     hy ways; I had forgo    . Below     o     hy nigh    ly
grave; where such as ye sleep be    ween shrouds,     o use ye     o     he
filling one a     las    .- Down, dog, and kennel!"

S    ar    ing a         he unforseen concluding exclama    ion of     he so suddenly
scornful old man, S    ubb was speechless a momen    ;     hen said exci    edly,
"I am no     used     o be spoken     o     ha     way, sir; I do bu     less     han half
like i    , sir."

"Avas    ! gri        ed Ahab be    ween his se         ee    h, and violen    ly moving
away, as if     o avoid some passiona    e     emp    a    ion.

"No, sir; no     ye    ," said S    ubb, emboldened, "I will no         amely be
called a dog, sir."

"Then be called     en     imes a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and
begone, or I'll clear     he world of     hee!"

As he said     his, Ahab advanced upon him wi    h such overbearing     errors
in his aspec    ,     ha     S    ubb involun    arily re    rea    ed.

"I was never served so before wi    hou     giving a hard blow for i    ,"
mu        ered S    ubb, as he found himself descending     he
cabin-scu        le. "I    's very queer. S    op, S    ubb; somehow, now, I don'    
well know whe    her     o go back and s    rike him, or- wha    's     ha    ?- down

The Pipe


When S    ubb had depar    ed, Ahab s    ood for a while leaning over     he
bulwarks; and     hen, as had been usual wi    h him of la    e, calling a
sailor of     he wa    ch, he sen     him below for his ivory s    ool, and also
his pipe. Ligh    ing     he pipe a         he binnacle lamp and plan    ing     he
s    ool on     he wea    her side of     he deck, he sa     and smoked.

In old Norse     imes,     he     hrones of     he sea-loving Danish kings were
fabrica    ed, sai    h     radi    ion, of     he     usks of     he narwhale. How could
one look a     Ahab     hen, sea    ed on     ha         ripod of bones, wi    hou    
be    hinking him of     he royal    y i     symbolized? For a Khan of     he plank,
and a king of     he sea and a grea     lord of Levia    hans was Ahab.

Some momen    s passed, during which     he     hick vapor came from his mou    h
in quick and cons    an     puffs, which blew back again in    o his
face. "How now," he soliloquized a     las    , wi    hdrawing     he     ube, "    his
smoking no longer soo    hes. Oh, my pipe! hard mus     i     go wi    h me if
    hy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously     oiling, no    
pleasuring- aye, and ignoran    ly smoking     o windward all     he while;     o
windward, and wi    h such nervous whiffs, as if, like     he dying whale,
my final je    s were     he s    ronges     and fulles     of     rouble. Wha    
business have I wi    h     his pipe? This     hing     ha     is mean     for
sereneness,     o send up mild whi    e vapors among mild whi    e hairs, no    
among     orn iron-grey locks like mine. I'll smoke no more-"

He     ossed     he s    ill ligh    ed pipe in    o     he sea. The fire hissed in     he
waves;     he same ins    an         he ship sho     by     he bubble     he sinking pipe
made. Wi    h slouched ha    , Ahab lurchingly paced     he planks.




Queen Mab


Nex     morning S    ubb accos    ed Flask.

"Such a queer dream, King-Pos    , I never had. You know     he old man's
ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me wi    h i    ; and when I     ried     o
kick back, upon my soul, my li        le man, I kicked my leg righ     off!
And     hen, pres    o! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I like a blazing fool,
kep     kicking a     i    . Bu     wha     was s    ill more curious, Flask- you know
how curious all dreams are-     hrough all     his rage     ha     I was in, I
somehow seemed     o be     hinking     o myself,     ha     af    er all, i     was no    
much of an insul    ,     ha     kick from Ahab.  'Why,'     hinks I, 'wha    's     he
row? I    's no     a real leg, only a false one.' And     here's a migh    y
difference be    ween a living     hump and a dead     hump. Tha    's wha     makes
a blow from     he hand, Flask, fif    y     imes more savage     o bear     han a
blow from a cane. The living member-     ha     makes     he living insul    , my
li        le man. And     hinks I     o myself all     he while, mind, while I was
s    ubbing my silly     oes agains         ha     cursed pyramid- so confoundedly
con    radic    ory was i     all, all     he while, I say, I was     hinking     o
myself, 'wha    's his leg now, bu     a cane-. a whale-bone cane. Yes,'
    hinks I, 'i     was only a playful cudgelling- in fac    , only a
whaleboning     ha     he gave me- no     a base kick. Besides,'     hinks I,
'look a     i     once; why,     he end of i    -     he foo     par    - wha     a small
sor     of end i     is; whereas, if a broad foo    ed farmer kicked me,
    here's a devilish broad insul    . Bu         his insul     is whi        led down     o
a poin     only.' Bu     now comes     he grea    es     joke of     he dream,
Flask. While I was ba        ering away a         he pyramid, a sor     of
badger-haired old merman, wi    h a hump on his back,     akes me by     he
shoulders, and slews me round. 'Wha     are you 'bou    ?' says he.  Slid!
man, bu     I was frigh    ened. Such a phiz! Bu    , somehow, nex     momen     I
was over     he frigh    . 'Wha     am I abou    ?' says I a     las    . 'And wha    
business is     ha     of yours, I should like     o know, Mr. Humpback? Do
you wan     a kick?' By     he lord, Flask, I had no sooner said     ha    ,     han
he     urned round his s    ern     o me, ben     over, and dragging up a lo     of
seaweed he had for a clou    - wha     do you     hink, I saw?- why     hunder
alive, man, his s    ern was s    uck full of marlinspikes, wi    h     he poin    s
ou    . Says I on second     hough    , 'I guess I won'     kick you, old

'Look ye here,' says he; 'le    's argue     he insul    . Cap    ain Ahab kicked

Already we are boldly launched upon     he deep; bu     soon we shall be

"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as     ha     which is en    i    led

"I     is no     my in    en    ion, were i     in my power,     o en    er in    o     he

"Unfi    ness     o pursue our research in     he unfa    homable wa    ers."
"Impene    rable veil covering our knowledge of     he ce    acea." "A field

Thus speak of     he whale,     he grea     Cuvier, and John Hun    er, and
Lesson,     hose ligh    s of zoology and ana    omy. Never    heless,     hough of

Many are     he men, small and grea    , old and new, landsmen and seamen,
who have a     large or in li        le, wri        en of     he whale. Run over a

Of     he names in     his lis     of whale au    hors only     hose following Owen
ever saw living whales; and bu     one of     hem was a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Cap    ain Scoresby. On     he separa    e

sperm whale, compared wi    h which     he Greenland whale is almos    
unwor    hy men    ioning. And here be i     said,     ha         he Greenland whale is
an usurper upon     he     hrone of     he seas. He is no     even by any means
    he larges     of     he whales. Ye    , owing     o     he long priori    y of his

which ignorance     o     his presen     day s    ill reigns in all bu     some few
scien    ific re    rea    s and whale-por    s;     his usurpa    ion has been every

    he grea     poe    s of pas     days, will sa    isfy you     ha         he Greenland

    he     ime has a     las     come for a new proclama    ion. This is Charing
Cross; hear ye! good people all,-     he Greenland whale is deposed,-
    he grea     sperm whale now reigne    h!

There are only     wo books in being which a     all pre    end     o pu         he
living sperm whale before you, and a         he same     ime, in     he remo    es

bo    h in     heir     ime surgeons     o     he English Sou    h-Sea whale-ships, and
bo    h exac     and reliable men. The original ma        er     ouching     he sperm
whale     o be found in     heir volumes is necessarily small; bu     so far
as i     goes, i     is of excellen     quali    y,     hough mos    ly confined     o

or poe    ic, lives no     comple    e in any li    era    ure. Far above all o    her

Now     he various species of whales need some sor     of popular
comprehensive classifica    ion, if only an easy ou    line one for     he

    ha     very reason infallibly be faul    y. I shall no     pre    end     o a

    o projec         he draugh     of a sys    ema    iza    ion of ce    ology. I am     he
archi    ec    , no         he builder.

Bu     i     is a ponderous     ask; no ordinary le        er-sor    er in     he
Pos    -Office is equal     o i    . To grope down in    o     he bo        om of     he sea
af    er     hem;     o have one's hands among     he unspeakable founda    ions,

I     ha     I should essay     o hook     he nose of     his levia    han! The awful
    aun    ings in Job migh     well appal me. "Will he (    he levia    han) make a
covenan     wi    h     hee? Behold     he hope of him is vain! Bu     I have swam
    hrough libraries and sailed     hrough oceans; I have had     o do wi    h
whales wi    h     hese visible hands; I am in earnes    ; and I will
    ry. There are some preliminaries     o se        le.

Firs    : The uncer    ain, unse        led condi    ion of     his science of Ce    ology
is in     he very ves    ibule a        es    ed by     he fac    ,     ha     in some quar    ers
i     s    ill remains a moo     poin     whe    her a whale be a fish. In his
Sys    em of Na    ure, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separa    e
    he whales from     he fish." Bu     of my own knowledge, I know     ha     down
    o     he year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, agains    
Linnaeus's express edic    , were s    ill found dividing     he possession of
    he same seas wi    h     he Levia    han.

The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished     he whales
from     he wa    ers, he s    a    es as follows: "On accoun     of     heir warm
bilocular hear    ,     heir lungs,     heir moveable eyelids,     heir hollow
ears, penem in    ran    em feminam mammis lac    an    em," and finally, "ex
lege na    urae jure meri    oque." I submi        ed all     his     o my friends
Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nan    ucke    , bo    h messma    es of mine
in a cer    ain voyage, and     hey uni    ed in     he opinion     ha         he reasons
se     for    h were al    oge    her insufficien    .  Charley profanely hin    ed
    hey were humbug.

Be i     known     ha    , waiving all argumen    , I     ake     he good old fashioned
ground     ha         he whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah     o back
me. This fundamen    al     hing se        led,     he nex     poin     is, in wha    
in    ernal respec     does     he whale differ from o    her fish. Above,
Linnaeus has given you     hose i    ems. Bu     in brief     hey are     hese:
lungs and warm blood; whereas, all o    her fish are lungless and cold
blooded.

Nex    : how shall we define     he whale, by his obvious ex    ernals, so as
conspicuously     o label him for all     ime     o come. To be shor    ,     hen, a
whale is a spou    ing fish wi    h a horizon    al     ail. There you have
him. However con    rac    ed,     ha     defini    ion is     he resul     of expanded
medi    a    ion. A walrus spou    s much like a whale, bu         he walrus is no    
a fish, because he is amphibious. Bu         he las         erm of     he defini    ion
is s    ill more cogen    , as coupled wi    h     he firs    . Almos     any one mus    
have no    iced     ha     all     he fish familiar     o landsmen have no     a fla    ,
bu     a ver    ical, or up-and-down     ail. Whereas, among spou    ing fish     he
    ail,     hough i     may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a
horizon    al posi    ion.

By     he above defini    ion of wha     a whale is, I do by no means exclude
from     he levia    hanic bro    herhood any sea crea    ure hi    her    o iden    ified
wi    h     he whale by     he bes     informed Nan    ucke    ers; nor, on     he o    her
hand, link wi    h i     any fish hi    her    o au    hori    a    ively regarded as
alien. Hence, all     he smaller, spou    ing and horizon    al     ailed fish
mus     be included in     his ground-plan of ce    ology. Now,     hen, come     he
grand divisions of     he en    ire whale hos    .

Firs    : According     o magni    ude I divide     he whales in    o     hree primary
BOOKS (subdivisible in    o CHAPTERS), and     hese shall comprehend     hem
all, bo    h small and large.

BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).
This whale, among     he English of old vaguely known as     he Trumpa
whale and     he Physe    er whale, and     he Anvil Headed whale, is     he
presen     Cachalo     of     he French, and     he Po        sfich of     he Germans, and
    he Macrocephalus of     he Long Words. He is, wi    hou     doub    ,     he
larges     inhabi    an     of     he globe;     he mos     formidable of all whales     o
encoun    er;     he mos     majes    ic in aspec    ; and las    ly, by far     he mos    
valuable in commerce; he being     he only crea    ure from which     ha    
valuable subs    ance, spermace    i, is ob    ained. All his peculiari    ies
will, in many o    her places, be enlarged upon. I     is chiefly wi    h his
name     ha     I now have     o do. Philologically considered, i     is
absurd. Some cen    uries ago, when     he sperm whale was almos     wholly
unknown in his own proper individuali    y, and when his oil was only
acciden    ally ob    ained from     he s    randed fish; in     hose days
spermace    i, i     would seem, was popularly supposed     o be derived from
a crea    ure iden    ical wi    h     he one     hen known in England as     he
Greenland or Righ     Whale. I     was     he idea also,     ha         his same
spermace    i was     ha     quickening humor of     he Greenland Whale which     he
firs     syllable of     he word li    erally expresses. In     hose     imes, also,
spermace    i was exceedingly scarce, no     being used for ligh    , bu     only
as an oin    men     and medicamen    . I     was only     o be had from     he
druggis    s as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine,
in     he course of     ime,     he     rue na    ure of spermace    i became known,
i    s original name was s    ill re    ained by     he dealers; no doub         o
enhance i    s value by a no    ion so s    rangely significan     of i    s
scarci    y. And so     he appella    ion mus     a     las     have come     o be
bes    owed upon     he whale from which     his spermace    i was really
derived.

BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Righ     Whale).
In one respec         his is     he mos     venerable of     he levia    hans, being

    he Greenland Whale;     he Black Whale;     he Grea     Whale;     he True

of     he English whaleman;     he Baliene Ordinaire of     he French
whalemen;     he Growlands Walfish of     he Swedes. I     is     he whale which
for more     han     wo cen    uries pas     has been hun    ed by     he Du    ch and
English in     he Arc    ic seas; i     is     he whale which     he American
fishermen have long pursued in     he Indian ocean, on     he Brazil Banks,
on     he Nor' Wes     Coas    , and various o    her par    s of     he world,

BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).
Under     his head I reckon a mons    er which, by     he various names of
Fin-Back, Tall-Spou    , and Long-John, has been seen almos     in every

Fin-back resembles     he righ     whale, bu     is of a less por    ly gir    h,

he derives his name, is of    en a conspicuous objec    . This fin is some
    hree or four fee     long, growing ver    ically from     he hinder par     of
    he back, of an angular shape, and wi    h a very sharp poin    ed

    his isola    ed fin will, a         imes, be seen plainly projec    ing from     he

spherical ripples, and     his gnomon-like fin s    ands up and cas    s
shadows upon     he wrinkled surface, i     may well be supposed     ha         he
wa    ery circle surrounding i     somewha     resembles a dial, wi    h i    s
s    yle and wavy hour-lines graved on i    . On     ha     Ahaz-dial     he shadow
of    en goes back. The Fin-Back is no     gregarious. He seems a
whale-ha    er, as some men are man-ha    ers. Very shy; always going
soli    ary; unexpec    edly rising     o     he surface in     he remo    es     and mos

misan    hropic spear upon a barren plain; gif    ed wi    h such wondrous
power and veloci    y in swimming, as     o defy all presen     pursui     from

race, bearing for his mark     ha     s    yle upon his back. From having     he
baleen in his mou    h,     he Fin-Back is some    imes included wi    h     he
righ     whale, among a     heore    ic species denomina    ed Whalebone whales,
    ha     is, whales wi    h baleen. Of     hese so-called Whalebone whales,
    here would seem     o be several varie    ies, mos     of which, however, are
li        le known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed
whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and ros    ra    ed whales, are
    he fisherman's names for a few sor    s.

In connexion wi    h     his appella    ive of "Whalebone whales," i     is of

a hump; bu         here     he simili    ude ceases. Then     his same humpbacked
whale and     he Greenland whale, each of     hese has baleen; bu         here
again     he simili    ude ceases. And i     is jus         he same wi    h     he o    her

BOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump Back).
This whale is of    en seen on     he nor    hern American coas    . He has been
frequen    ly cap    ured     here, and     owed in    o harbor. He has a grea     pack

BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razar Back).
Of     his whale li        le is known bu     his name. I have seen him a     a

Thus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Oc    avo).

OCTAVOES. These embrace     he whales of middling magni    ude, among which
presen     may be numbered:

I.       he Grampus;
II.      he Black Fish;
III.     he Narwhale;
IV.      he Thrasher;
V.       he Killer.

BOOK II. (Oc    avo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).
Though     his fish, whose loud sonorous brea    hing, or ra    her blowing,
has furnished a proverb     o landsmen, is so well known a denizen of
    he deep, ye     is he no     popularly classed among whales. Bu    
possessing all     he grand dis    inc    ive fea    ures of     he levia    han, mos    
na    uralis    s have recognised him for one. He is of modera    e oc    ave
size, varying from fif    een     o     wen    y-five fee     in leng    h, and of
corresponding dimensions round     he wais    . He swims in herds; he is
never regularly hun    ed,     hough his oil is considerable in quan    i    y,
and pre        y good for ligh    . By some fishermen his approach is regarded
as premoni    ory of     he advance of     he grea     sperm whale.

BOOK II. (Oc    avo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).
I give     he popular fishermen's names for all     hese fish, for
generally     hey are     he bes    .  Where any name happens     o be vague or
inexpressive, I shall say so, and sugges     ano    her. I do so now
    ouching     he Black Fish, so called because blackness is     he rule
among almos     all whales. So, call him     he Hyena Whale, if you
please. His voraci    y is well known and from     he circums    ance     ha         he
inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an
everlas    ing Mephis    ophelean grin on his face. This whale averages
some six    een or eigh    een fee     in leng    h. He is found in almos     all
la    i    udes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in
swimming, which looks some    hing like a Roman nose. When no     more
profi    ably employed,     he sperm whale hun    ers some    imes cap    ure     he
Hyena whale,     o keep up     he supply of cheap oil for domes    ic
employmen    - as some frugal housekeepers, in     he absence of company,
and qui    e alone by     hemselves, burn unsavory     allow ins    ead of
odorous wax. Though     heir blubber is very     hin, some of     hese whales
will yield you upwards of     hir    y gallons of oil.

BOOK II. (Oc    avo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale),     ha     is, Nos    ril whale.
Ano    her ins    ance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from
his peculiar horn being originally mis    aken for a peaked nose. The
crea    ure is some six    een fee     in leng    h, while i    s horn averages five
fee    ,     hough some exceed     en, and even a        ain     o fif    een
fee    . S    ric    ly speaking,     his horn is bu     a leng    hened     usk, growing
ou     from     he jaw in a line a li        le depressed from     he
horizon    al. Bu     i     is only found on     he sinis    er side, which has an
ill effec    , giving i    s owner some    hing analogous     o     he aspec     of a
clumsy lef    -handed man. Wha     precise purpose     his ivory horn or lance
answers, i     would be hard     o say. I     does no     seem     o be used like
    he blade of     he sword-fish and bill-fish;     hough some sailors     ell
me     ha         he Narwhale employs i     for a rake in     urning over     he bo        om
of     he sea for food. Charley Coffin said i     was used for an
ice-piercer; for     he Narwhale, rising     o     he surface of     he Polar
Sea, and finding i     shee    ed wi    h ice,     hrus    s his horn up, and so
breaks     hrough. Bu     you canno     prove ei    her of     hese surmises     o be
correc    . My own opinion is,     ha     however     his one-sided horn may
really be used by     he Narwhale- however     ha     may be- i     would
cer    ainly be very convenien         o him for a folder in reading
pamphle    s. The Narwhale I have heard called     he Tusked whale,     he
Horned whale, and     he Unicorn whale. He is cer    ainly a curious
example of     he Unicornism     o be found in almos     every kingdom of
anima    ed na    ure. From cer    ain clois    ered old au    hors I have ga    hered
    ha         his same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancien     days regarded as     he
grea     an    ido    e agains     poison, and as such, prepara    ions of i    
brough     immense prices. I     was also dis    illed     o a vola    ile sal    s for
fain    ing ladies     he same way     ha         he horns of     he male deer are
manufac    ured in    o har    shorn. Originally i     was in i    self accoun    ed an
objec     of grea     curiosi    y. Black Le        er     ells me     ha     Sir Mar    in
Frobisher on his re    urn from     ha     voyage, when Queen Bess did
gallan    ly wave her jewelled hand     o him from a window of Greenwich
Palace, as his bold ship sailed down     he Thames; "when Sir Mar    in
re    urned from     ha     voyage," sai    h Black Le        er, "on bended knees he
presen    ed     o her highness a prodigious long horn of     he Narwhale,
which for a long period af    er hung in     he cas    le a     Windsor." An
Irish au    hor avers     ha         he Earl of Leices    er, on bended knees, did
likewise presen         o her highness ano    her horn, per    aining     o a land
beas     of     he unicorn na    ure.

The Narwhale has a very pic    uresque, leopard-like look, being of a
milk-whi    e ground color, do        ed wi    h round and oblong spo    s of
black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; bu         here is li        le
of i    , and he is seldom hun    ed. He is mos    ly found in     he circumpolar
seas.

BOOK II. (Oc    avo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).
Of     his whale li        le is precisely known     o     he Nan    ucke    er, and
no    hing a     all     o     he professed na    uralis    s. From wha     I have seen of
him a     a dis    ance, I should say     ha     he was abou         he bigness of a
grampus. He is very savage- a sor     of Feegee fish. He some    imes     akes
    he grea     Folio whales by     he lip, and hangs     here like a leech,     ill
    he migh    y bru    e is worried     o dea    h. The Killer is never hun    ed. I
never heard wha     sor     of oil he has. Excep    ion migh     be     aken     o     he
name bes    owed upon     his whale, on     he ground of i    s
indis    inc    ness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea;
Bonapar    es and Sharks included.

BOOK II. (Oc    avo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).
This gen    leman is famous for his     ail which he uses for a ferule in
    hrashing his foes. He moun    s     he Folio whale's back, and as he
swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some schoolmas    ers
ge     along in     he world by a similar process. S    ill less is known of
    he Thrasher     han of     he Killer. Bo    h are ou    laws, even in     he
lawless seas.

Thus ends BOOK II. (Oc    avo), and begins BOOK III, (Duodecimo.)

DUODECIMOES.- These include     he smaller whales.

I.   The Huzza Porpoise.
II.  The Algerine Porpoise.
III. The Mealy-mou    hed Porpoise.

To     hose who have no     chanced specially     o s    udy     he subjec    , i     may
possibly seem s    range,     ha     fishes no     commonly exceeding four or
five fee     should be marshalled among WHALES- a word, which, in     he
popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. Bu         he crea    ures

BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).
This is     he common porpoise found all over     he globe. The name is of
my own bes    owal; for     here are more     han one sor     of porpoises, and
some    hing mus     be done     o dis    inguish     hem.  I call him     hus, because
he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon     he broad sea keep
    ossing     hemselves     o heaven like caps in a Four    h-of-July
crowd. Their appearance is generally hailed wi    h deligh     by     he
mariner. Full of fine spiri    s,     hey invariably come from     he breezy

    hree cheers a     beholding     hese vivacious fish,     hen heaven help ye;
    he spiri     of godly gamesomeness is no     in ye.  A well-fed, plump
Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. Bu         he

Sperm whale himself in minia    ure.

BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).
A pira    e. Very savage. He is only found, I     hink, in     he Pacific. He
is somewha     larger     han     he Huzza Porpoise, bu     much of     he same

lowered for him many     imes, bu     never ye     saw him cap    ured.

BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mou    hed Porpoise).
The larges     kind of Porpoise; and only found in     he Pacific, so far
as i     is known. The only English name, by which he has hi    her    o been

circums    ance     ha     he is chiefly found in     he vicini    y of     ha    
Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from     he Huzza Porpoise,
being of a less ro    und and jolly gir    h; indeed, he is of qui    e a nea    
and gen    leman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (mos     o    her
porpoises have), he has a lovely     ail, and sen    imen    al Indian eyes of
a hazel hue. Bu     his mealy-mou    h spoils him. Though his en    ire back
down     o his side fins is of a deep sable, ye     a boundary line,
dis    inc     as     he mark in a ship's hull, called     he "brigh     wais    ,"
    ha     line s    reaks him from s    em     o s    ern, wi    h     wo separa    e colors,
black above and whi    e below. The whi    e comprises par     of his head,
and     he whole of his mou    h, which makes him look as if he had jus    
escaped from a felonious visi         o a meal-bag. A mos     mean and mealy
aspec    ! His oil is much like     ha     of     he common porpoise.

Beyond     he DUODECIMO,     his sys    em does no     proceed, inasmuch as     he

The Specksynder


Concerning     he officers of     he whale-craf    ,     his seems as good a
place as any     o se     down a li        le domes    ic peculiari    y on ship-board,
arising from     he exis    ence of     he harpooneer class of officers, a
class unknown of course in any o    her marine     han     he whale-flee    .

The large impor    ance a        ached     o     he harpooneer's voca    ion is evinced
by     he fac    ,     ha     originally in     he old Du    ch Fishery,     wo cen    uries
and more ago,     he command of a whale-ship was no     wholly lodged in
    he person now called     he cap    ain, bu     was divided be    ween him and an
officer called     he Specksynder. Li    erally     his word means Fa    -Cu        er;
usage, however, in     ime made i     equivalen         o Chief Harpooneer. In
    hose days,     he cap    ain's au    hori    y was res    ric    ed     o     he naviga    ion
and general managemen     of     he vessel; while over     he whale-hun    ing
depar    men     and all i    s concerns,     he Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer
reigned supreme. In     he Bri    ish Greenland Fishery, under     he
corrup    ed     i    le of Specksioneer,     his old Du    ch official is s    ill
re    ained, bu     his former digni    y is sadly abridged. A     presen     he
ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is bu     one of     he
cap    ain's more inferior subal    erns. Never    heless, as upon     he good
conduc     of     he harpooneers     he success of a whaling voyage largely
depends, and since in     he American Fishery he is no     only an
impor    an     officer in     he boa    , bu     under cer    ain circums    ances (nigh    
wa    ches on a whaling ground)     he command of     he ship's deck is also
his;     herefore     he grand poli    ical maxim of     he sea demands,     ha     he
should nominally live apar     from     he men before     he mas    , and be in
some way dis    inguished as     heir professional superior;     hough always,
by     hem, familiarly regarded as     heir social equal.

Now,     he grand dis    inc    ion be    ween officer and man a     sea, is     his-
    he firs     lives af    ,     he las     forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
merchan    men alike,     he ma    es have     heir quar    ers wi    h     he cap    ain;
and so,     oo, in mos     of     he American whalers     he harpooneers are
lodged in     he af    er par     of     he ship. Tha     is     o say,     hey     ake     heir
meals in     he cap    ain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirec    ly
communica    ing wi    h i    .

Though     he long period of a Sou    hern whaling voyage (by far     he
longes     of all voyages now or ever made by man),     he peculiar perils
of i    , and     he communi    y of in    eres     prevailing among a company, all
of whom, high or low, depend for     heir profi    s, no     upon fixed wages,
bu     upon     heir common luck,     oge    her wi    h     heir common vigilance,
in    repidi    y, and hard work;     hough all     hese     hings do in some cases
    end     o bege     a less rigorous discipline     han in merchan    men
generally; ye    , never mind how much like an old Mesopo    amian family
    hese whalemen may, in some primi    ive ins    ances, live     oge    her; for
all     ha    ,     he punc    ilious ex    ernals, a     leas    , of     he quar    er-deck
are seldom ma    erially relaxed, and in no ins    ance done away. Indeed,
many are     he Nan    ucke     ships in which you will see     he skipper
parading his quar    er-deck wi    h an ela    ed grandeur no     surpassed in
any mili    ary navy; nay, ex    or    ing almos     as much ou    ward homage as if
he wore     he imperial purple, and no         he shabbies     of pilo    -clo    h.

And     hough of all men     he moody cap    ain of     he Pequod was     he leas    
given     o     ha     sor     of shallowes     assump    ion; and     hough     he only
homage he ever exac    ed, was implici    , ins    an    aneous obedience;     hough
he required no man     o remove     he shoes from his fee     ere s    epping
upon     he quar    er-deck; and     hough     here were     imes when, owing     o
peculiar circums    ances connec    ed wi    h even    s hereaf    er     o be
de    ailed, he addressed     hem in unusual     erms, whe    her of
condescension or in     errorem, or o    herwise; ye     even Cap    ain Ahab was
by no means unobservan     of     he paramoun     forms and usages of     he sea.

Nor, perhaps, will i     fail     o be even    ually perceived,     ha     behind
    hose forms and usages, as i     were, he some    imes masked himself;
inciden    ally making use of     hem for o    her and more priva    e ends     han
    hey were legi    ima    ely in    ended     o subserve. Tha     cer    ain sul    anism
of his brain, which had o    herwise in a good degree remained
unmanifes    ed;     hrough     hose forms     ha     same sul    anism became
incarna    e in an irresis    ible dic    a    orship.  For be a man's
in    ellec    ual superiori    y wha     i     will, i     can never assume     he
prac    ical, available supremacy over o    her men, wi    hou         he aid of
some sor     of ex    ernal ar    s and en    renchmen    s, always, in     hemselves,

    rue princes of     he Empire from     he world's hus    ings; and leaves     he
highes     honors     ha         his air can give,     o     hose men who become famous
more     hrough     heir infini    e inferiori    y     o     he choice hidden handful
of     he Divine Iner    ,     han     hrough     heir undoub    ed superiori    y over

    hings when ex    reme poli    ical supers    i    ions inves         hem,     ha     in some
royal ins    ances even     o idio     imbecili    y     hey have impar    ed

crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain;     hen,     he
plebeian herds crouch abased before     he     remendous

Bu     Ahab, my Cap    ain, s    ill moves before me in all his Nan    ucke    
grimness and shagginess; and in     his episode     ouching Emperors and
Kings, I mus     no     conceal     ha     I have only     o do wi    h a poor old
whale-hun    er like him; and,     herefore, all ou    ward majes    ical
    rappings and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! wha     shall be grand

The Cabin-Table


I     is noon; and Dough-Boy,     he s    eward,     hrus    ing his pale
loaf-of-bread face from     he cabin-scu        le, announces dinner     o his
lord and mas    er who, si        ing in     he lee quar    er-boa    , has jus     been
    aking an observa    ion of     he sun; and is now mu    ely reckoning     he
la    i    ude on     he smoo    h, medallion-shaped     able    , reserved for     ha    
daily purpose on     he upper par     of his ivory leg. From his comple    e
ina        en    ion     o     he     idings, you would     hink     ha     moody Ahab had no    
heard his menial. Bu     presen    ly, ca    ching hold of     he mizen shrouds,
he swings himself     o     he deck, and in an even, unexhilara    ed voice,
saying, "Dinner, Mr. S    arbuck," disappears in    o     he cabin.

When     he las     echo of his sul    an's s    ep has died away, and S    arbuck,
    he firs     Emir, has every reason     o suppose     ha     he is sea    ed,     hen
S    arbuck rouses from his quie    ude,     akes a few     urns along     he
planks, and, af    er a grave peep in    o     he binnacle, says, wi    h some
    ouch of pleasan    ness, "Dinner, Mr. S    ubb," and descends     he
scu        le. The second Emir lounges abou         he rigging awhile, and     hen
sligh    ly shaking     he main brace,     o see whe    her i     will be all righ    
wi    h     ha     impor    an     rope, he likewise     akes up     he old burden, and
wi    h a rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows af    er his predecessors.

Bu         he     hird Emir, now seeing himself all alone on     he quar    er-deck,
seems     o feel relieved from some curious res    rain    ; for,     ipping all
sor    s of knowing winks in all sor    s of direc    ions, and kicking off
his shoes, he s    rikes in    o a sharp bu     noiseless squall of a hornpipe
righ     over     he Grand Turk's head; and     hen, by a dex    erous sleigh    ,
pi    ching his cap up in    o     he mizen    op for a shelf, he goes down
rollicking so far a     leas     as he remains visible from     he deck,
reversing all o    her processions, by bringing up     he rear wi    h
music. Bu     ere s    epping in    o     he cabin doorway below, he pauses,
ships a new face al    oge    her, and,     hen, independen    , hilarious li        le
Flask en    ers King Ahab's presence, in     he charac    er of Abjec    us, or
    he Slave.

I     is no         he leas     among     he s    range     hings bred by     he in    ense
ar    ificialness of sea-usages,     ha     while in     he open air of     he deck
some officers will, upon provoca    ion, bear     hemselves boldly and
defyingly enough     owards     heir commander; ye    ,     en     o one, le         hose
very officers     he nex     momen     go down     o     heir cus    omary dinner in
    ha     same commander's cabin, and s    raigh    way     heir inoffensive, no    
    o say depreca    ory and humble air     owards him, as he si    s a         he head
of     he     able;     his is marvellous, some    imes mos     comical. Wherefore
    his difference? A problem? Perhaps no    . To have been Belshazzar,
King of Babylon; and     o have been Belshazzar, no     haugh    ily bu    
cour    eously,     herein cer    ainly mus     have been some     ouch of mundane
grandeur. Bu     he who in     he righ    ly regal and in    elligen     spiri    
presides over his own priva    e dinner-    able of invi    ed gues    s,     ha    
man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for     he
    ime;     ha     man's royal    y of s    a    e     ranscends Belshazzar's, for
Belshazzar was no         he grea    es    . Who has bu     once dined his friends,
has     as    ed wha     i     is     o be Caesar. I     is a wi    chery of social
czarship which     here is no wi    hs    anding. Now, if     o     his
considera    ion you super-add     he official supremacy of a ship-mas    er,
    hen, by inference, you will derive     he cause of     ha     peculiari    y of
sea-life jus     men    ioned.

Over his ivory-inlaid     able, Ahab presided like a mu    e, maned
sea-lion on     he whi    e coral beach, surrounded by his war-like bu    
s    ill deferen    ial cubs. In his own proper     urn, each officer wai    ed
    o be served. They were as li        le children before Ahab; and ye    , in
Ahab,     here seemed no         o lurk     he smalles     social arrogance. Wi    h
one mind,     heir in    en     eyes all fas    ened upon     he old man's knife, as
he carved     he chief dish before him.  I do no     suppose     ha     for     he
world     hey would have profaned     ha     momen     wi    h     he sligh    es    
observa    ion, even upon so neu    ral a     opic as     he wea    her. No! And
when reaching ou     his knife and fork, be    ween which     he slice of beef
was locked, Ahab     hereby mo    ioned S    arbuck's pla    e     owards him,     he
ma    e received his mea     as     hough receiving alms; and cu     i         enderly;
and a li        le s    ar    ed if, perchance,     he knife grazed agains         he
pla    e; and chewed i     noiselessly; and swallowed i    , no     wi    hou    
circumspec    ion. For, like     he Corona    ion banque     a     Frankfor    , where
    he German Emperor profoundly dines wi    h     he seven imperial elec    ors,
so     hese cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, ea    en in awful
silence; and ye     a         able old Ahab forbade no     conversa    ion; only he
himself was dumb. Wha     a relief i     was     o choking S    ubb, when a ra    
made a sudden racke     in     he hold below. And poor li        le Flask, he was
    he younges     son, and li        le boy of     his weary family par    y. His were
    he shin-bones of     he saline beef; his would have been     he
drums    icks. For Flask     o have presumed     o help himself,     his mus    
have seemed     o him     an    amoun         o larceny in     he firs     degree. Had he
helped himself a         he     able, doub    less, never more would he have been
able     o hold his head up in     his hones     world; never    heless, s    range
    o say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,     he
chances were Ahab had never so much as no    iced i    . Leas     of all, did
Flask presume     o help himself     o bu        er. Whe    her he     hough         he
owners of     he ship denied i         o him, on accoun     of i    s clo        ing his
clear, sunny complexion; or whe    her he deemed     ha    , on so long a
voyage in such marke    less wa    ers, bu        er was a     a premium, and
    herefore was no     for him, a subal    ern; however i     was, Flask, alas!
was a bu        erless man!

Ano    her     hing. Flask was     he las     person down a         he dinner, and
Flask is     he firs     man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was
badly jammed in poin     of     ime. S    arbuck and S    ubb bo    h had     he s    ar    
of him; and ye         hey also have     he privilege of lounging in     he
rear. If S    ubb even, who is bu     a peg higher     han Flask, happens     o
have bu     a small appe    i    e, and soon shows symp    oms of concluding his
repas    ,     hen Flask mus     bes    ir himself, he will no     ge     more     han
    hree mou    hfuls     ha     day; for i     is agains     holy usage for S    ubb     o
precede Flask     o     he deck. Therefore i     was     ha     Flask once admi        ed
in priva    e,     ha     ever since he had arisen     o     he digni    y of an
officer, from     ha     momen     he had never known wha     i     was     o be
o    herwise     han hungry, more or less. For wha     he a    e did no     so much
relieve his hunger, as keep i     immor    al in him. Peace and
sa    isfac    ion,     hough     Flask, have for ever depar    ed from my
s    omach. I am an officer; bu    , how I wish I could fish a bi     of
old-fashioned beef in     he fore-cas    le, as I used     o when I was before
    he mas    . There's     he frui     of promo    ion now;     here's     he vani    y of
glory:     here's     he insani    y of life! Besides, if i     were so     ha     any
mere sailor of     he Pequod had a grudge agains     Flask in Flask's
official capaci    y, all     ha     sailor had     o do, in order     o ob    ain
ample vengeance, was     o go af     a     dinner    ime, and ge     a peep a     Flask
    hrough     he cabin sky-ligh    , si        ing silly and dumfoundered before
awful Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his     hree ma    es formed wha     may be called     he firs    
    able in     he Pequod's cabin. Af    er     heir depar    ure,     aking place in
inver    ed order     o     heir arrival,     he canvas clo    h was cleared, or
ra    her was res    ored     o some hurried order by     he pallid s    eward. And
    hen     he     hree harpooneers were bidden     o     he feas    ,     hey being i    s
residuary lega    ees.  They made a sor     of     emporary servan    s' hall of
    he high and migh    y cabin.

In s    range con    ras         o     he hardly     olerable cons    rain     and nameless

harpooneers chewed     heir food wi    h such a relish     ha         here was a
repor         o i    . They dined like lords;     hey filled     heir bellies like
Indian ships all day loading wi    h spices. Such por    en    ous appe    i    es
had Queequeg and Tash    ego,     ha         o fill ou         he vacancies made by     he
previous repas    , of    en     he pale Dough-Boy was fain     o bring on a
grea     baron of sal    -junk, seemingly quarried ou     of     he solid ox. And
if he were no     lively abou     i    , if he did no     go wi    h a nimble
hop-skip-and-jump,     hen Tash    ego had an ungen    lemanly way of
accelera    ing him by dar    ing a fork a     his back, harpoon-wise. And
once Daggoo, seized wi    h a sudden humor, assis    ed Dough-Boy's memory
by sna    ching him up bodily, and     hrus    ing his head in    o a grea     emp    y
wooden     rencher, while Tash    ego, knife in hand, began laying ou         he
circle preliminary     o scalping him. He was na    urally a very nervous,
shuddering sor     of li        le fellow,     his bread-faced s    eward;     he
progeny of a bankrup     baker and a hospi    al nurse.  And wha     wi    h     he
s    anding spec    acle of     he black     errific Ahab, and     he periodical
    umul    uous visi    a    ions of     hese     hree savages, Dough-Boy's whole life
was one con    inual lip-quiver. Commonly, af    er seeing     he harpooneers
furnished wi    h all     hings     hey demanded, he would escape from     heir
clu    ches in    o his li        le pan    ry adjoining, and fearfully peep ou     a    
    hem     hrough     he blinds of i    s door,     ill all was over.

I     was a sigh         o see Queequeg sea    ed over agains     Tash    ego, opposing
his filed     ee    h     o     he Indian's; crosswise     o     hem, Daggoo sea    ed on

    he low carlines; a     every mo    ion of his colossal limbs, making     he
low cabin framework     o shake, as when an African elephan     goes
passenger in a ship. Bu     for all     his,     he grea     negro was
wonderfully abs    emious, no         o say dain    y. I     seemed hardly possible
    ha     by such compara    ively small mou    hfuls he could keep up     he
vi    ali    y diffused     hrough so broad, baronial, and superb a
person. Bu    , doub    less,     his noble savage fed s    rong and drank deep
of     he abounding elemen     of air; and     hrough his dila    ed nos    rils
snuffed in     he sublime life of     he worlds. No     by beef or by bread,
are gian    s made or nourished. Bu     Queequeg, he had a mor    al, barbaric
smack of     he lip in ea    ing- an ugly sound enough- so much so,     ha    
    he     rembling Dough-Boy almos     looked     o see whe    her any marks of
    ee    h lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear Tash    ego
singing ou     for him     o produce himself,     ha     his bones migh     be
picked,     he simple-wi        ed s    eward all bu     sha        ered     he crockery
hanging round him in     he pan    ry, by his sudden fi    s of     he palsy. Nor
did     he whe    s    one which     he harpooneers carried in     heir pocke    s, for
    heir lances and o    her weapons; and wi    h which whe    s    ones, a     dinner,
    hey would os    en    a    iously sharpen     heir knives;     ha     gra    ing sound
did no     a     all     end     o     ranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he
forge         ha     in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, mus     cer    ainly
have been guil    y of some murderous, convivial indiscre    ion. Alas!
Dough-Boy! hard fares     he whi    e wai    er who wai    s upon cannibals. No    
a napkin should he carry on his arm, bu     a buckler. In good     ime,
    hough,     o his grea     deligh    ,     he     hree sal    -sea warriors would rise
and depar    ;     o his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all     heir mar    ial
bones jingling in     hem a     every s    ep, like Moorish scime    ars in
scabbards.

Bu    ,     hough     hese barbarians dined in     he cabin, and nominally lived
    here; s    ill, being any    hing bu     seden    ary in     heir habi    s,     hey were
scarcely ever in i     excep     a     meal    imes, and jus     before

In     his one ma        er, Ahab seemed no excep    ion     o mos     American whale

    ha     anybody else is, a     any     ime, permi        ed     here. So     ha    , in real

said     o have lived ou     of     he cabin     han in i    . For when     hey did

inwards for a momen    , only     o be     urned ou         he nex    ; and, as a
permanen         hing, residing in     he open air. Nor did     hey lose much
hereby; in     he cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was
inaccessible. Though nominally included in     he census of Chris    endom,
he was s    ill an alien     o i    . He lived in     he world, as     he las     of
    he Grisly Bears lived in se        led Missouri. And as when Spring and
Summer had depar    ed,     ha     wild Logan of     he woods, burying himself in
    he hollow of a     ree, lived ou         he win    er     here, sucking his own

    he caved     runk of his body,     here fed upon     he sullen paws of i    s

The Mas    -Head


I     was during     he more pleasan     wea    her,     ha     in due ro    a    ion wi    h
    he o    her seamen my firs     mas    -head came round.

In mos     American whalemen     he mas    -heads are manned almos    
simul    aneously wi    h     he vessel's leaving her por    ; even     hough she
may have fif    een     housand miles, and more,     o sail ere reaching her
proper cruising ground. And if, af    er a     hree, four, or five years'
voyage she is drawing nigh home wi    h any    hing emp    y in her- say, an
emp    y vial even-     hen, her mas    -heads are kep     manned     o     he las    !
and no         ill her skysail-poles sail in among     he spires of     he por    ,
does she al    oge    her relinquish     he hope of cap    uring one whale more.

Now, as     he business of s    anding mas    -heads, ashore or afloa    , is a
very ancien     and in    eres    ing one, le     us in some measure expa    ia    e
here. I     ake i    ,     ha         he earlies     s    anders of mas    -heads were     he
old Egyp    ians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior     o

doub    less, by     heir     ower, have in    ended     o rear     he lof    ies

gone by     he board, in     he dread gale of God's wra    h;     herefore, we
canno     give     hese Babel builders priori    y over     he Egyp    ians. And
    ha         he Egyp    ians were a na    ion of mas    -head s    anders, is an
asser    ion based upon     he general belief among archaeologis    s,     ha    
    he firs     pyramids were founded for as    ronomical purposes: a     heory
singularly suppor    ed by     he peculiar s    airlike forma    ion of all four
sides of     hose edifices; whereby, wi    h prodigious long uplif    ings of
    heir legs,     hose old as    ronomers were won         o moun         o     he apex, and
sing ou     for new s    ars; even as     he look-ou    s of a modern ship sing
ou     for a sail, or a whale jus     bearing in sigh    . In Sain     S    yli    es,
    he famous Chris    ian hermi     of old     imes, who buil     him a lof    y s    one
pillar in     he deser     and spen         he whole la        er por    ion of his life

ou         o     he las    , li    erally died a     his pos    . Of modern
s    anders-of-mas    -heads we have bu     a lifeless se    ; mere s    one, iron,
and bronze men; who,     hough well capable of facing ou     a s    iff gale,
are s    ill en    irely incompe    en         o     he business of singing ou     upon
discovering any s    range sigh    . There is Napoleon; who, upon     he     op
of     he column of Vendome s    ands wi    h arms folded, some one hundred
and fif    y fee     in     he air; careless, now, who rules     he decks below,
whe    her Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis     he Devil.  Grea    
Washing    on,     oo, s    ands high alof     on his     owering main-mas     in
Bal    imore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks     ha    
poin     of human grandeur beyond which few mor    als will go. Admiral
Nelson, also, on a caps    an of gun-me    al, s    ands his mas    -head in
Trafalgar Square; and even when mos     obscured by     ha     London smoke,
    oken is ye     given     ha     a hidden hero is     here; for where     here is
smoke, mus     be fire. Bu     nei    her grea     Washing    on, nor Napoleon, nor
Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked
    o befriend by     heir counsels     he dis    rac    ed decks upon which     hey

    hrough     he     hick haze of     he fu    ure, and descry wha     shoals and wha    
rocks mus     be shunned.

I     may seem unwarran    able     o couple in any respec         he mas    -head
s    anders of     he land wi    h     hose of     he sea; bu         ha     in     ru    h i     is
no     so, is plainly evinced by an i    em for which Obed Macy,     he sole
his    orian of Nan    ucke    , s    ands accoun    able. The wor    hy Obed     ells us,
    ha     in     he early     imes of     he whale fishery, ere ships were
regularly launched in pursui     of     he game,     he people of     ha     island
erec    ed lof    y spars along     he seacoas    ,     o which     he look-ou    s

whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying     he game, gave no    ice     o
    he ready-manned boa    s nigh     he beach. Bu         his cus    om has now become
obsole    e;     urn we     hen     o     he one proper mas    -head,     ha     of a

In one of     hose sou    hern whalesmen, on a long     hree or four years'

any o    her of     hose small and snug con    rivances in which men

cross    rees. Here,     ossed abou     by     he sea,     he beginner feels abou    
as cosy as he would s    anding on a bull's horns. To be sure, in cold
wea    her you may carry your house alof     wi    h you, in     he shape of a
wa    ch-coa    ; bu     properly speaking     he     hickes     wa    ch-coa     is no more
of a house     han     he unclad body; for as     he soul is glued inside of
i    s fleshy     abernacle, and canno     freely move abou     in i    , nor even
move ou     of i    , wi    hou     running grea     risk of perishing (like an
ignoran     pilgrim crossing     he snowy Alps in win    er); so a wa    ch-coa    
is no     so much of a house as i     is a mere envelope, or addi    ional
skin encasing you. You canno     pu     a shelf or ches     of drawers in your
body, and no more can you make a convenience close     of your

Concerning all     his, i     is much     o be deplored     ha         he mas    -heads of

richer. Nor are     hese moni    ions a     all unneeded. For nowadays,     he
whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many roman    ic, melancholy, and
absen    -minded young men, disgus    ed wi    h     he corking care of ear    h,
and seeking sen    imen     in     ar and blubber. Childe Harold no    
unfrequen    ly perches himself upon     he mas    -head of some luckless

           "Roll on,     hou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!
       Ten     housand blubber-hun    ers sweep over     hee in vain."

Very of    en do     he cap    ains of such ships     ake     hose absen    -minded

The Quar    er-Deck


(En    er Ahab: Then, all)

I     was no     a grea     while af    er     he affair of     he pipe,     ha     one
morning shor    ly af    er breakfas    , Ahab, as was his won    , ascended     he
cabin-gangway     o     he deck. There mos     sea-cap    ains usually walk a    
    ha     hour, as coun    ry gen    lemen, af    er     he same meal,     ake a few
    urns in     he garden.

Soon his s    eady, ivory s    ride was heard, as     o and fro he paced his
old rounds, upon planks so familiar     o his     read,     ha         hey were all
over den    ed, like geological s    ones, wi    h     he peculiar mark of his
walk. Did you fixedly gaze,     oo, upon     ha     ribbed and den    ed brow;
    here also, you would see s    ill s    ranger foo    -prin    s-     he foo    -prin    s
of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing     hough    .

Bu     on     he occasion in ques    ion,     hose den    s looked deeper, even as
his nervous s    ep     ha     morning lef     a deeper mark. And, so full of his
    hough     was Ahab,     ha     a     every uniform     urn     ha     he made, now a         he
main-mas     and now a         he binnacle, you could almos     see     ha         hough    
    urn in him as he     urned, and pace in him as he paced; so comple    ely
possessing him, indeed,     ha     i     all bu     seemed     he inward mould of
every ou    er movemen    .

"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered S    ubb; "    he chick     ha    's in him
pecks     he shell. 'Twill soon be ou    ."

The hours wore on;- Ahab now shu     up wi    hin his cabin; anon, pacing
    he deck, wi    h     he same in    ense bigo    ry of purpose in his aspec    .

I     drew near     he close of day. Suddenly he came     o a hal     by     he
bulwarks, and inser    ing his bone leg in    o     he auger-hole     here, and
wi    h one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered S    arbuck     o send
everybody af    .

"Sir!" said     he ma    e, as    onished a     an order seldom or never given on
ship-board excep     in some ex    raordinary case.

"Send everybody af    ," repea    ed Ahab. "Mas    -heads,     here! come down!"

When     he en    ire ship's company were assembled, and wi    h curious and
no     wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked no    
unlike     he wea    her horizon when a s    orm is coming up, Ahab, af    er
rapidly glancing over     he bulwarks, and     hen dar    ing his eyes among
    he crew, s    ar    ed from his s    andpoin    ; and as     hough no     a soul were
nigh him resumed his heavy     urns upon     he deck. Wi    h ben     head and
half-slouched ha     he con    inued     o pace, unmindful of     he wondering
whispering among     he men;     ill S    ubb cau    iously whispered     o Flask,
    ha     Ahab mus     have summoned     hem     here for     he purpose of wi    nessing
a pedes    rian fea    . Bu         his did no     las     long. Vehemen    ly pausing, he
cried:-

"Wha     do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"

"Sing ou     for him!" was     he impulsive rejoinder from a score of
clubbed voices.

"Good!" cried Ahab, wi    h a wild approval in his     ones; observing     he
hear    y anima    ion in    o which his unexpec    ed ques    ion had so
magne    ically     hrown     hem.

"And wha     do ye nex    , men?"

"Lower away, and af    er him!"

"And wha         une is i     ye pull     o, men?"

"A dead whale or a s    ove boa    !"

More and more s    rangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew     he
coun    enance of     he old man a     every shou    ; while     he mariners began
    o gaze curiously a     each o    her, as if marvelling how i     was     ha    
    hey     hemselves became so exci    ed a     such seemingly purposeless
ques    ions.

Bu    ,     hey were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in
his pivo    -hole, wi    h one hand reaching high up a shroud, and     igh    ly,
almos     convulsively grasping i    , addressed     hem     hus:-

"All ye mas    -headers have before now heard me give orders abou     a
whi    e whale.  Look ye! d'ye see     his Spanish ounce of gold?"- holding
up a broad brigh     coin     o     he sun- "i     is a six    een dollar piece,
men. D'ye see i    ? Mr. S    arbuck, hand me yon     op-maul."

While     he ma    e was ge        ing     he hammer, Ahab, wi    hou     speaking, was
slowly rubbing     he gold piece agains         he skir    s of his jacke    , as if
    o heigh    en i    s lus    re, and wi    hou     using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming     o himself, producing a sound so s    rangely muffled and
inar    icula    e     ha     i     seemed     he mechanical humming of     he wheels of
his vi    ali    y in him.

Receiving     he     op-maul from S    arbuck, he advanced     owards     he
main-mas     wi    h     he hammer uplif    ed in one hand, exhibi    ing     he gold
wi    h     he o    her, and wi    h a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever
of ye raises me a whi    e-headed whale wi    h a wrinkled brow and a
crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me     ha     whi    e-headed whale, wi    h
    hree holes punc    ured in his s    arboard fluke- look ye, whosoever of
ye raises me     ha     same whi    e whale, he shall have     his gold ounce, my
boys!"

"Huzza! huzza!" cried     he seamen, as wi    h swinging     arpaulins     hey
hailed     he ac     of nailing     he gold     o     he mas    .

"I    's a whi    e whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he     hrew down     he
    opmaul: "a whi    e whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
whi    e wa    er; if ye see bu     a bubble, sing ou    ."

All     his while Tash    ego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on wi    h even
more in    ense in    eres     and surprise     han     he res    , and a         he men    ion

"Cap    ain Ahab," said Tash    ego, "    ha     whi    e whale mus     be     he same
    ha     some call Moby Dick."

"Moby Dick?" shou    ed Ahab. "Do ye know     he whi    e whale     hen, Tash?"

"Does he fan-    ail a li        le curious, sir, before he goes down?" said
    he Gay-Header delibera    ely.

"And has he a curious spou    ,     oo," said Daggoo, "very bushy, even for
a parmace        y, and migh    y quick, Cap    ain Ahab?"

"And he have one,     wo,     hree- oh! good many iron in him hide,     oo,
Cap    ain," cried Queequeg disjoin    edly, "all     wiske-    ee be-    wisk, like
him- him-" fal    ering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
round as     hough uncorking a bo        le- "like him- him-"

"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg,     he harpoons lie all     wis    ed
and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spou     is a big one, like a
whole shock of whea    , and whi    e as a pile of our Nan    ucke     wool af    er

"Cap    ain Ahab," said S    arbuck, who, wi    h S    ubb and Flask, had     hus
far been eyeing his superior wi    h increasing surprise, bu     a     las    
seemed s    ruck wi    h a     hough     which somewha     explained all     he

"Who     old     hee     ha    ?" cried Ahab;     hen pausing, "Aye, S    arbuck; aye,

Then     ossing bo    h arms, wi    h measureless impreca    ions he shou    ed ou    :
"Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round     he Horn,

"Aye, aye!" shou    ed     he harpooneers and seamen, running closer     o     he
exci    ed old man: "A sharp eye for     he whi    e whale; a sharp lance for

"God bless ye," he seemed     o half sob and half shou    . "God bless ye,

"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for     he jaws of Dea    h     oo,

"God keep me!- keep us all!" murmured S    arbuck, lowly.

Bu     in his joy a         he enchan    ed,     aci     acquiescence of     he ma    e, Ahab

"The measure!     he measure!" cried Ahab.

Receiving     he brimming pew    er, and     urning     o     he harpooneers, he
ordered     hem     o produce     heir weapons. Then ranging     hem before him

"Drink and pass!" he cried, handing     he heavy charged flagon     o     he

"Advance, ye ma    es! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Le

doing, suddenly and nervously     wi    ched     hem; meanwhile glancing

Ahab re    ired wi    hin his cabin.




Sunse    


The cabin; by     he s    ern windows; Ahab si        ing alone, and gazing ou    .

I leave a whi    e and     urbid wake; pale wa    ers, paler cheeks, where'er
I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell     o whelm my     rack; le    
    hem; bu     firs     I pass.

Yonder, by ever-brimming goble    's rim,     he warm waves blush like
wine. The gold brow plumbs     he blue. The diver sun- slow dived from
noon- goes down; my soul moun    s up! she wearies wi    h her endless
hill. Is,     hen,     he crown     oo heavy     ha     I wear?     his Iron Crown of
Lombardy. Ye     is i     brigh     wi    h many a gem; I     he wearer, see no     i    s
far flashings; bu     darkly feel     ha     I wear     ha    ,     ha     dazzlingly
confounds. 'Tis iron-     ha     I know- no     gold. 'Tis spli    ,     oo-     ha     I
feel;     he jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems     o bea     agains         he

Dry hea     upon my brow? Oh!     ime was, when as     he sunrise nobly
spurred me, so     he sunse     soo    hed. No more. This lovely ligh    , i    
ligh    s no     me; all loveliness is anguish     o me, since I can ne'er
enjoy. Gif    ed wi    h     he high percep    ion, I lack     he low, enjoying
power; damned, mos     sub    ly and mos     malignan    ly! damned in     he mids    
of Paradise! Good nigh    -good nigh    ! (waving his hand, he moves from

'Twas no     so hard a     ask. I     hough         o find one s    ubborn, a         he

willed; and wha     I've willed, I'll do! They     hink me mad- S    arbuck
does; bu     I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened! Tha     wild madness
    ha    's only calm     o comprehend i    self! The prophecy was     ha     I should
be dismembered; and- Aye! I los         his leg. I now prophesy     ha     I will
dismember my dismemberer. Now,     hen, be     he prophe     and     he fulfiller
one. Tha    's more     han ye, ye grea     gods, ever were. I laugh and hoo    
a     ye, ye cricke    -players, ye pugilis    s, ye deaf Burkes and blinded
Bendigoes! I will no     say as schoolboys do     o bullies- Take some one
of your own size; don'     pommel me! No, ye've knocked me down, and I
am up again; bu     ye have run and hidden. Come for    h from behind your
co        on bags! I have no long gun     o reach ye. Come, Ahab's complimen    s
    o ye; come and see if ye can swerve me.  Swerve me? ye canno     swerve
me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye     here. Swerve me?  The pa    h
    o my fixed purpose is laid wi    h iron rails, whereon my soul is
grooved     o run.  Over unsounded gorges,     hrough     he rifled hear    s of
moun    ains, under     orren    s' beds, unerringly I rush! Naugh    's an
obs    acle, naugh    's an angle     o     he iron way!

Moby Dick


I, Ishmael, was one of     ha     crew; my shou    s had gone up wi    h     he
res    ; my oa    h had been welded wi    h     heirs; and s    ronger I shou    ed,
and more did I hammer and clinch my oa    h, because of     he dread in my
soul. A wild, mys    ical, sympa    he    ical feeling was in me; Ahab's
quenchless feud seemed mine. Wi    h greedy ears I learned     he his    ory
of     ha     murderous mons    er agains     whom I and all     he o    hers had     aken
our oa    hs of violence and revenge.

For some     ime pas    ,     hough a     in    ervals only,     he unaccompanied,
secluded Whi    e Whale had haun    ed     hose uncivilized seas mos    ly
frequen    ed by     he Sperm Whale fishermen. Bu     no     all of     hem knew of
his exis    ence; a few of     hem, compara    ively, had knowingly seen him;
while     he number who as ye     had ac    ually and knowingly given ba        le
    o him, was small indeed. For, owing     o     he large number of
whale-cruisers;     he disorderly way     hey were sprinkled over     he
en    ire wa    ery circumference, many of     hem adven    urously pushing     heir
ques     along soli    ary la    i    udes, so as seldom or never for a whole
    welvemon    h or more on a s    re    ch,     o encoun    er a single news-    elling
sail of any sor    ;     he inordina    e leng    h of each separa    e voyage;     he

    hrough     he whole world-wide whaling-flee     of     he special
individualizing     idings concerning Moby Dick. I     was hardly     o be
doub    ed,     ha     several vessels repor    ed     o have encoun    ered, a     such
or such a     ime, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of
uncommon magni    ude and maligni    y, which whale, af    er doing grea    
mischief     o his assailan    s, has comple    ely escaped     hem;     o some
minds i     was no     an unfair presump    ion, I say,     ha         he whale in
ques    ion mus     have been no o    her     han Moby Dick. Ye     as of la    e     he
Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and no     unfrequen    
ins    ances of grea     feroci    y, cunning, and malice in     he mons    er
a        acked;     herefore i     was,     ha         hose who by acciden     ignoran    ly
gave ba        le     o Moby Dick; such hun    ers, perhaps, for     he mos     par    ,
were con    en         o ascribe     he peculiar     error he bred, more, as i    
were,     o     he perils of     he Sperm Whale fishery a     large,     han     o     he
individual cause. In     ha     way, mos    ly,     he disas    rous encoun    er
be    ween Ahab and     he whale had hi    her    o been popularly regarded.

And as for     hose who, previously hearing of     he Whi    e Whale, by
chance caugh     sigh     of him; in     he beginning of     he     hing     hey had
every one of     hem, almos    , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,
as for any o    her whale of     ha     species. Bu     a     leng    h, such
calami    ies did ensue in     hese assaul    s- no     res    ric    ed     o sprained
wris    s and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring ampu    a    ions- bu     fa    al
    o     he las     degree of fa    ali    y;     hose repea    ed disas    rous repulses,
all accumula    ing and piling     heir     errors upon Moby Dick;     hose
    hings had gone far     o shake     he for    i    ude of many brave hun    ers,     o
whom     he s    ory of     he Whi    e Whale had even    ually come.

Nor did wild rumors of all sor    s fail     o exaggera    e, and s    ill     he
more horrify     he     rue his    ories of     hese deadly encoun    ers. For no    
only do fabulous rumors na    urally grow ou     of     he very body of all

wild rumors abound, wherever     here is any adequa    e reali    y for     hem

whale fishery surpasses every o    her sor     of mari    ime life, in     he
wonderfulness and fearfulness of     he rumors which some    imes circula    e
    here. For no     only are whalemen as a body unexemp     from     ha    
ignorance and supers    i    iousness heredi    ary     o all sailors; bu     of all

calling as he does,     he whaleman is wrapped by influences all     ending
    o make his fancy pregnan     wi    h many a migh    y bir    h. No wonder,     hen,
    ha     ever ga    hering volume from     he mere     ransi     over     he wildes

even    ually inves    ed Moby Dick wi    h new     errors unborrowed from
any    hing     ha     visibly appears. So     ha     in many cases such a panic did
he finally s    rike,     ha     few who by     hose rumors, a     leas    , had heard
of     he Whi    e Whale, few of     hose hun    ers were willing     o encoun    er

Bu         here were s    ill o    her and more vi    al prac    ical influences a

Sperm Whale, as fearfully dis    inguished from all o    her species of     he

    hose     his day among     hem, who,     hough in    elligen     and courageous
enough in offering ba        le     o     he Greenland or Righ     whale, would
perhaps- ei    her from professional inexperience, or incompe    ency, or
    imidi    y, decline a con    es     wi    h     he Sperm Whale; a     any ra    e,     here

Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended,     han on board of     hose
prows which s    em him.

And as if     he now     es    ed reali    y of his migh     had in former legendary
    imes     hrown i    s shadow before i    ; we find some book na    uralis    s-
Olassen and Povelson- declaring     he Sperm Whale no     only     o be a

incredibly ferocious as con    inually     o be a    hirs     for human

almos     similar impressions effaced. For in his Na    ural His    ory,     he
Baron himself affirms     ha     a     sigh     of     he Sperm Whale, all fish
(sharks included) are "s    ruck wi    h     he mos     lively     errors," and
"of    en in     he precipi    ancy of     heir fligh     dash     hemselves agains    
    he rocks wi    h such violence as     o cause ins    an    aneous dea    h." And
however     he general experiences in     he fishery may amend such repor    s
as     hese; ye     in     heir full     erribleness, even     o     he blood    hirs    y

Never    heless, some     here were, who even in     he face of     hese     hings
were ready     o give chase     o Moby Dick; and a s    ill grea    er number
who, chancing only     o hear of him dis    an    ly and vaguely, wi    hou         he

I     is a     hing well known     o bo    h American and English whale-ships,
and as well a     hing placed upon au    hori    a    ive record years ago by
Scoresby,     ha     some whales have been cap    ured far nor    h in     he
Pacific, in whose bodies have been found     he barbs of harpoons dar    ed
in     he Greenland seas. Nor is i         o be gainsaid,     ha     in some of
    hese ins    ances i     has been declared     ha         he in    erval of     ime
be    ween     he     wo assaul    s could no     have exceeded very many
days. Hence, by inference, i     has been believed by some whalemen,
    ha         he Nor' Wes     Passage, so long a problem     o man, was never a
problem     o     he whale. So     ha     here, in     he real living experience of
living men,     he prodigies rela    ed in old     imes of     he inland S    rello
moun    ain in Por    ugal (near whose     op     here was said     o be a lake in
which     he wrecks of ships floa    ed up     o     he surface); and     ha     s    ill
more wonderful s    ory of     he Are    husa foun    ain near Syracuse (whose
wa    ers were believed     o have come from     he Holy Land by an
underground passage);     hese fabulous narra    ions are almos     fully
equalled by     he reali    ies of     he whalemen.

Forced in    o familiari    y,     hen, wi    h such prodigies as     hese; and
knowing     ha     af    er repea    ed, in    repid assaul    s,     he Whi    e Whale had
escaped alive; i     canno     be much ma        er of surprise     ha     some
whalemen should go s    ill fur    her in     heir supers    i    ions; declaring
Moby Dick no     only ubiqui    ous, bu     immor    al (for immor    ali    y is bu    
ubiqui    y in     ime);     ha         hough groves of spears should be plan    ed in
his flanks, he would s    ill swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should
ever be made     o spou         hick blood, such a sigh     would be bu     a
ghas    ly decep    ion; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of
leagues away, his unsullied je     would once more be seen.

Bu     even s    ripped of     hese superna    ural surmisings,     here was enough
in     he ear    hly make and incon    es    able charac    er of     he mons    er     o
s    rike     he imagina    ion wi    h unwon    ed power. For, i     was no     so much
his uncommon bulk     ha     so much dis    inguished him from o    her sperm
whales, bu    , as was elsewhere     hrown ou    - a peculiar snow-whi    e
wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical whi    e hump. These were his
prominen     fea    ures;     he     okens whereby, even in     he limi    less,
unchar    ed seas, he revealed his iden    i    y, a     a long dis    ance,     o
    hose who knew him.

The res     of his body was so s    reaked, and spo        ed, and marbled wi    h
    he same shrouded hue,     ha    , in     he end, he had gained his
dis    inc    ive appella    ion of     he Whi    e Whale; a name, indeed, li    erally
jus    ified by his vivid aspec    , when seen gliding a     high noon     hrough
a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all
spangled wi    h golden gleamings.

Nor was i     his unwon    ed magni    ude, nor his remarkable hue, nor ye    
his deformed lower jaw,     ha     so much inves    ed     he whale wi    h na    ural
    error, as     ha     unexampled, in    elligen     maligni    y which, according     o
specific accoun    s, he had over and over again evinced in his
assaul    s. More     han all, his     reacherous re    rea    s s    ruck more of
dismay     han perhaps augh     else. For, when swimming before his
exul    ing pursuers, wi    h every apparen     symp    om of alarm, he had
several     imes been known     o     urn round suddenly, and, bearing down
upon     hem, ei    her s    ave     heir boa    s     o splin    ers, or drive     hem back
in cons    erna    ion     o     heir ship.

Already several fa    ali    ies had a        ended his chase. Bu         hough similar
disas    ers, however li        le brui    ed ashore, were by no means unusual in
    he fishery; ye    , in mos     ins    ances, such seemed     he Whi    e Whale's
infernal afore    hough     of feroci    y,     ha     every dismembering or dea    h
    ha     he caused, was no     wholly regarded as having been inflic    ed by
an unin    elligen     agen    .

Judge,     hen,     o wha     pi    ches of inflamed, dis    rac    ed fury     he minds
of his more despera    e hun    ers were impelled, when amid     he chips of
chewed boa    s, and     he sinking limbs of     orn comrades,     hey swam ou    
of     he whi    e curds of     he whale's direful wra    h in    o     he serene,
exaspera    ing sunligh    ,     ha     smiled on, as if a     a bir    h or a bridal.

His     hree boa    s s    ove around him, and oars and men bo    h whirling in
    he eddies; one cap    ain, seizing     he line-knife from his broken prow,
had dashed a         he whale, as an Arkansas duellis     a     his foe, blindly
seeking wi    h a six inch blade     o reach     he fa    hom-deep life of     he
whale. Tha     cap    ain was Ahab. And     hen i     was,     ha     suddenly sweeping
his sickle-shaped lower jaw benea    h him, Moby Dick had reaped away
Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in     he field. No     urbaned
Turk, no hired Vene    ian or Malay, could have smo    e him wi    h more
seeming malice. Small reason was     here     o doub    ,     hen,     ha     ever
since     ha     almos     fa    al encoun    er, Ahab had cherished a wild
vindic    iveness agains         he whale, all     he more fell for     ha     in his
fran    ic morbidness he a     las     came     o iden    ify wi    h him, no     only all
his bodily woes, bu     all his in    ellec    ual and spiri    ual
exaspera    ions. The Whi    e Whale swam before him as     he monomaniac
incarna    ion of all     hose malicious agencies which some deep men feel
ea    ing in     hem,     ill     hey are lef     living on wi    h half a hear     and
half a lung. Tha     in    angible maligni    y which has been from     he
beginning;     o whose dominion even     he modern Chris    ians ascribe
one-half of     he worlds; which     he ancien     Ophi    es of     he eas    
reverenced in     heir s    a    ue devil;- Ahab did no     fall down and worship
i     like     hem; bu     deliriously     ransferring i    s idea     o     he abhorred
whi    e whale, he pi        ed himself, all mu    ila    ed, agains     i    . All     ha    
mos     maddens and     ormen    s; all     ha     s    irs up     he lees of     hings; all
    ru    h wi    h malice in i    ; all     ha     cracks     he sinews and cakes     he
brain; all     he sub    le demonisms of life and     hough    ; all evil,     o
crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made prac    ically assailable
in Moby Dick. He piled upon     he whale's whi    e hump     he sum of all     he
general rage and ha    e fel     by his whole race from Adam down; and
    hen, as if his ches     had been a mor    ar, he burs     his ho     hear    's
shell upon i    .

I     is no     probable     ha         his monomania in him     ook i    s ins    an     rise
a         he precise     ime of his bodily dismembermen    . Then, in dar    ing a    
    he mons    er, knife in hand, he had bu     given loose     o a sudden,
passiona    e, corporal animosi    y; and when he received     he s    roke     ha    
    ore him, he probably bu     fel         he agonizing bodily lacera    ion, bu    
no    hing more.  Ye    , when by     his collision forced     o     urn     owards
home, and for long mon    hs of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay
s    re    ched     oge    her in one hammock, rounding in mid win    er     ha    
dreary, howling Pa    agonian Cape;     hen i     was,     ha     his     orn body and
gashed soul bled in    o one ano    her; and so in    erfusing, made him
mad. Tha     i     was only     hen, on     he homeward voyage, af    er     he
encoun    er,     ha         he final monomania seized him, seems all bu     cer    ain
from     he fac         ha    , a     in    ervals during     he passage, he was a raving
luna    ic; and,     hough unlimbed of a leg, ye     such vi    al s    reng    h ye    
lurked in his Egyp    ian ches    , and was moreover in    ensified by his
delirium,     ha     his ma    es were forced     o lace him fas    , even     here, as
he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a s    rai    -jacke    , he swung     o     he
mad rockings of     he gales. And, when running in    o more sufferable
la    i    udes,     he ship, wi    h mild s    un'sails spread, floa    ed across     he
    ranquil     ropics, and,     o all appearances,     he old man's delirium
seemed lef     behind him wi    h     he Cape Horn swells, and he came for    h
from his dark den in    o     he blessed ligh     and air; even     hen, when he
bore     ha     firm, collec    ed fron    , however pale, and issued his calm
orders once again; and his ma    es     hanked God     he direful madness was
now gone; even     hen, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human
madness is of    en    imes a cunning and mos     feline     hing. When you     hink
i     fled, i     may have bu     become     ransfigured in    o some s    ill sub    ler
form. Ahab's full lunacy subsided no    , bu     deepeningly con    rac    ed;
like     he unaba    ed Hudson, when     ha     noble Nor    hman flows narrowly,
bu     unfa    homably     hrough     he Highland gorge. Bu    , as in his
narrow-flowing monomania, no     one jo     of Ahab's broad madness had
been lef     behind; so in     ha     broad madness, no     one jo     of his grea    
na    ural in    ellec     had perished. Tha     before living agen    , now became
    he living ins    rumen    . If such a furious     rope may s    and, his special
lunacy s    ormed his general sani    y, and carried i    , and     urned all i    s
concen    red cannon upon i    s own mad mark; so     ha     far from having los    
his s    reng    h, Ahab,     o     ha     one end, did now possess a     housand fold
more po    ency     han ever he had sanely brough         o bear upon any one
reasonable objec    .

This is much; ye     Ahab's larger, darker, deeper par     remains
unhin    ed. Bu     vain     o popularize profundi    ies, and all     ru    h is
profound. Winding far down from wi    hin     he very hear     of     his spiked
Ho    el de Cluny where we here s    and- however grand and wonderful, now

he did bege     ye, ye young exiled royal    ies; and from your grim sire
only will     he old S    a    e-secre     come.

Now, in his hear    , Ahab had some glimpse of     his, namely; all my
means are sane, my mo    ive and my objec     mad. Ye     wi    hou     power     o
kill, or change, or shun     he fac    ; he likewise knew     ha         o mankind
he did long dissemble; in some sor    , did s    ill. Bu         ha         hing of his
dissembling was only subjec         o his percep    ibili    y, no         o his will
de    ermina    e. Never    heless, so well did he succeed in     ha    
dissembling,     ha     when wi    h ivory leg he s    epped ashore a     las    , no
Nan    ucke    er     hough     him o    herwise     han bu     na    urally grieved, and
    ha         o     he quick, wi    h     he     errible casual    y which had over    aken
him.

The repor     of his undeniable delirium a     sea was likewise popularly
ascribed     o a kindred cause. And so     oo, all     he added moodiness
which always af    erwards,     o     he very day of sailing in     he Pequod on
    he presen     voyage, sa     brooding on his brow. Nor is i     so very
unlikely,     ha     far from dis    rus    ing his fi    ness for ano    her whaling
voyage, on accoun     of such dark symp    oms,     he calcula    ing people of
    ha     pruden     isle were inclined     o harbor     he concei    ,     ha     for     hose
very reasons he was all     he be        er qualified and se     on edge, for a
pursui     so full of rage and wildness as     he bloody hun     of
whales. Gnawed wi    hin and scorched wi    hou    , wi    h     he infixed,
unrelen    ing fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be
found, would seem     he very man     o dar     his iron and lif     his lance
agains         he mos     appalling of all bru    es. Or, if for any reason
    hough         o be corporeally incapaci    a    ed for     ha    , ye     such an one
would seem superla    ively compe    en         o cheer and howl on his
underlings     o     he a        ack. Bu     be all     his as i     may, cer    ain i     is,
    ha     wi    h     he mad secre     of his unaba    ed rage bol    ed up and keyed in
him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon     he presen     voyage wi    h     he one
only and all-engrossing objec     of hun    ing     he Whi    e Whale. Had any
one of his old acquain    ances on shore bu     half dreamed of wha     was
lurking in him     hen, how soon would     heir aghas     and righ    eous souls
have wrenched     he ship from such a fiendish man! They were ben     on
profi    able cruises,     he profi         o be coun    ed down in dollars from     he
min    . He was in    en     on an audacious, immi    igable, and superna    ural
revenge.

Here,     hen, was     his grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing wi    h
curses Job's whale round     he world, a         he head of a crew,     oo,
chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and cas    aways, and cannibals-
morally enfeebled also, by     he incompe    ence of mere unaided vir    ue or
righ    -mindedness in S    arbuck,     he invunerable jolli    y of indifference
and recklessness in S    ubb, and     he pervading mediocri    y in
Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed
by some infernal fa    ali    y     o help him     o his monomaniac revenge. How

from     ha     pallor of     he dead, we borrow     he expressive hue of     he

Therefore, in his o    her moods, symbolize wha    ever grand or gracious

Bu         hou sayes    , me    hinks     ha     whi    e-lead chap    er abou     whi    eness is

Tell me, why     his s    rong young col    , foaled in some peaceful valley

No; bu     here     hou beholdes     even in a dumb bru    e,     he ins    inc     of     he

Thus,     hen,     he muffled rollings of a milky sea;     he bleak rus    lings

Though nei    her knows where lie     he nameless     hings of which     he

I remember     he firs     alba    ross I ever saw. I     was during a prolonged

and wi    h a hooked, Roman bill sublime. A     in    ervals, i     arched for    h

Bu     a     las     I awoke; and     urning, asked a sailor wha     bird was

is i     conceivable     ha         his glorious     hing is u        erly unknown     o men

Hark!


"HIST! Did you hear     ha     noise, Cabaco?

I     was     he middle-wa    ch: a fair moonligh    ;     he seamen were s    anding

careful no         o speak or rus    le     heir fee    . From hand     o hand,     he
bucke    s wen     in     he deepes     silence, only broken by     he occasional
flap of a sail, and     he s    eady hum of     he unceasingly advancing keel.

I     was in     he mids     of     his repose,     ha     Archy, one of     he cordon,
whose pos     was near     he af    er-ha    ches, whispered     o his neighbor, a
Cholo,     he words above.

"His    ! did you hear     ha     noise, Cabaco?"

"Take     he bucke    , will ye, Archy? wha     noise d'ye mean?"

"There i     is again- under     he ha    ches- don'     you hear i    - a cough- i    
sounded like a cough."

"Cough be damned! Pass along     ha     re    urn bucke    ."

"There again-     here i     is!- i     sounds like     wo or     hree sleepers

"Caramba!  have done, shipma    e, will ye?  I    's     he     hree soaked

"Say wha     ye will, shipma    e; I've sharp ears."

"Aye, you are     he chap, ain'     ye,     ha     heard     he hum of     he old

"Grin away; we'll see wha         urns up. Hark ye, Cabaco,     here is
somebody down in     he af    er-hold     ha     has no     ye     been seen on deck;

"Tish!     he bucke    !"




The Char    


Had you followed Cap    ain Ahab down in    o his cabin af    er     he squall
    ha         ook place on     he nigh     succeeding     ha     wild ra    ifica    ion of his
purpose wi    h his crew, you would have seen him go     o a locker in     he
    ransom, and bringing ou     a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
char    s, spread     hem before him on his screwed-down     able. Then
sea    ing himself before i    , you would have seen him in    en    ly s    udy     he
various lines and shadings which     here me     his eye; and wi    h slow bu    
s    eady pencil     race addi    ional courses over spaces     ha     before were
blank. A     in    ervals, he would refer     o piles of old log-books beside
him, wherein were se     down     he seasons and places in which, on
various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been
cap    ured or seen.

While     hus employed,     he heavy pew    er lamp suspended in chains over
his head, con    inually rocked wi    h     he mo    ion of     he ship, and for
ever     hrew shif    ing gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled
brow,     ill i     almos     seemed     ha     while he himself was marking ou    
lines and courses on     he wrinkled char    s, some invisible pencil was
also     racing lines and courses upon     he deeply marked char     of his
forehead.

Bu     i     was no         his nigh     in par    icular     ha    , in     he soli    ude of his
cabin, Ahab     hus pondered over his char    s. Almos     every nigh         hey
were brough     ou    ; almos     every nigh     some pencil marks were effaced,
and o    hers were subs    i    u    ed. For wi    h     he char    s of all four oceans
before him, Ahab was     hreading a maze of curren    s and eddies, wi    h a
view     o     he more cer    ain accomplishmen     of     ha     monomaniac     hough     of
his soul.

Now,     o any one no     fully acquain    ed wi    h     he ways of     he levia    hans,
i     migh     seem an absurdly hopeless     ask     hus     o seek ou     one soli    ary
crea    ure in     he unhooped oceans of     his plane    . Bu     no     so did i    
seem     o Ahab, who knew     he se    s of all     ides and curren    s; and
    hereby calcula    ing     he drif    ings of     he sperm whale's food; and,
also calling     o mind     he regular, ascer    ained seasons for hun    ing him
in par    icular la    i    udes; could arrive a     reasonable surmises, almos    
approaching     o cer    ain    ies, concerning     he     imelies     day     o be upon
    his or     ha     ground in search of his prey.

So assured, indeed, is     he fac     concerning     he periodicalness of     he
sperm whale's resor    ing     o given wa    ers,     ha     many hun    ers believe
    ha    , could he be closely observed and s    udied     hroughou         he world;
were     he logs for one voyage of     he en    ire whale flee     carefully
colla    ed,     hen     he migra    ions of     he sperm whale would be found     o
correspond in invariabili    y     o     hose of     he herring-shoals or     he
fligh    s of swallows. On     his hin    , a        emp    s have been made     o
cons    ruc     elabora    e migra    ory char    s of     he sperm whale.

Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground     o ano    her,
    he sperm whales, guided by some infallible ins    inc    - say, ra    her,
secre     in    elligence from     he Dei    y- mos    ly swim in veins, as     hey are
called; con    inuing     heir way along a given ocean-line wi    h such
undevia    ing exac    i    ude,     ha     no ship ever sailed her course, by any
char    , wi    h one     i    he of such marvellous precision. Though, in     hese
cases,     he direc    ion     aken by any one whale be s    raigh     as a
surveyor's parallel, and     hough     he line of advance be s    ric    ly
confined     o i    s own unavoidable, s    raigh     wake, ye         he arbi    rary
vein in which a         hese     imes he is said     o swim, generally embraces
some few miles in wid    h (more or less, as     he vein is presumed     o
expand or con    rac    ); bu     never exceeds     he visual sweep from     he
whale-ship's mas    -heads, when circumspec    ly gliding along     his magic
zone. The sum is,     ha     a     par    icular seasons wi    hin     ha     bread    h and
along     ha     pa    h, migra    ing whales may wi    h grea     confidence be looked
for.

And hence no     only a     subs    an    ia    ed     imes, upon well known separa    e
feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope     o encoun    er his prey; bu     in
crossing     he wides     expanses of wa    er be    ween     hose grounds he could,
by his ar    , so place and     ime himself on his way, as even     hen no         o
be wholly wi    hou     prospec     of a mee    ing.

There was a circums    ance which a     firs     sigh     seemed     o en    angle his
delirious bu     s    ill me    hodical scheme. Bu     no     so in     he reali    y,
perhaps. Though     he gregarious sperm whales have     heir regular
seasons for par    icular grounds, ye     in general you canno     conclude
    ha         he herds which haun    ed such and such a la    i    ude or longi    ude
    his year, say, will     urn ou         o be iden    ically     he same wi    h     hose
    ha     were found     here     he preceding season;     hough     here are peculiar
and unques    ionable ins    ances where     he con    rary of     his has proved
    rue. In general,     he same remark, only wi    hin a less wide limi    ,
applies     o     he soli    aries and hermi    s among     he ma    ured, aged sperm
whales. So     ha         hough Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for
example, on wha     is called     he Seychelle ground in     he Indian ocean,
or Volcano Bay on     he Japanese Coas    ; ye     i     did no     follow     ha     were
    he Pequod     o visi     ei    her of     hose spo    s a     any subsequen    
corresponding season, she would infallibly encoun    er him     here. So,
    oo, wi    h some o    her feeding-grounds, where he had a         imes revealed
himself. Bu     all     hese seemed only his casual s    opping-places and
ocean-inns, so     o speak, no     his places of prolonged abode. And where
Ahab's chances of accomplishing his objec     have hi    her    o been spoken
of, allusion has only been made     o wha    ever way-side, an    eceden    ,
ex    ra prospec    s were his, ere a par    icular se         ime or place were
a        ained, when all possibili    ies would become probabili    ies, and, as
Ahab fondly     hough    , every possibili    y     he nex         hing     o a
cer    ain    y. Tha     par    icular se         ime and place were conjoined in     he
one     echnical phrase-     he Season-on-    he-Line. For     here and     hen, for
several consecu    ive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried,
lingering in     hose wa    ers for awhile, as     he sun, in i    s annual

man had found     he awful mo    ive     o his vengeance. Bu     in     he cau    ious
comprehensiveness and unloi    ering vigilance wi    h which Ahab     hrew his
brooding soul in    o     his unfal    ering hun    , he would no     permi     himself
    o res     all his hopes upon     he one crowning fac     above men    ioned,
however fla        ering i     migh     be     o     hose hopes; nor in     he
sleeplessness of his vow could he so     ranquillize his unquie     hear    
as     o pos    pone all in    ervening ques    .

Now,     he Pequod had sailed from Nan    ucke     a         he very beginning of
    he Season-on-    he-Line. No possible endeavor     hen could enable her
commander     o make     he grea     passage sou    hwards, double Cape Horn, and
    hen running down six    y degrees of la    i    ude arrive in     he equa    orial
Pacific in     ime     o cruise     here. Therefore, he mus     wai     for     he nex    
ensuing season. Ye         he prema    ure hour of     he Pequod's sailing had,
perhaps, been correc    ly selec    ed by Ahab, wi    h a view     o     his very
complexion of     hings. Because, an in    erval of     hree hundred and
six    y-five days and nigh    s was before him; an in    erval which, ins    ead
of impa    ien    ly enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous
hun    ; if by chance     he Whi    e Whale, spending his vaca    ion in seas far
remo    e from his periodical feeding-grounds, should     urn up his
wrinkled brow off     he Persian Gulf, or in     he Bengal Bay, or China
Seas, or in any o    her wa    ers haun    ed by his race. So     ha     Monsoons,
Pampas, Nor-Wes    ers, Harma        ans, Traders; any wind bu         he Levan    er
and Simoon, migh     blow Moby Dick in    o     he devious zig-zag
world-circle of     he Pequod's circumnaviga    ing wake.

Bu     gran    ing all     his; ye    , regarded discree    ly and coolly, seems i    
no     bu     a mad idea,     his;     ha     in     he broad boundless ocean, one
soli    ary whale, even if encoun    ered, should be     hough     capable of
individual recogni    ion from his hun    er, even as a whi    e-bearded Muf    i
in     he     hronged     horoughfares of Cons    an    inople? Yes. For     he
peculiar snow-whi    e brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-whi    e hump, could
no     bu     be unmis    akable. And have I no         allied     he whale, Ahab would
mu        er     o himself, as af    er poring over his char    s     ill long af    er
midnigh     he would     hrow himself back in reveries-     allied him, and
shall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped ou     like a
los     sheep's are! And here, his mad mind would run on in a brea    hless
race;     ill a weariness and fain    ness of pondering came over him! and
in     he open air of     he deck he would seek     o recover his
s    reng    h. Ah, God! wha         rances of     ormen    s does     ha     man endure who
is consumed wi    h one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps wi    h
clenched hands; and wakes wi    h his own bloody nails in his palms.

Of    en, when forced from his hammock by exhaus    ing and in    olerably
vivid dreams of     he nigh    , which, resuming his own in    ense     hough    s
    hrough     he day, carried     hem on amid a clashing of phrensies, and
whirled     hem round and round and round in his blazing brain,     ill     he
very     hrobbing of his life-spo     became insufferable anguish; and
when, as was some    imes     he case,     hese spiri    ual     hroes in him heaved
his being up from i    s base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from
which forked flames and ligh    nings sho     up, and accursed fiends
beckoned him     o leap down among     hem; when     his hell in himself
yawned benea    h him, a wild cry would be heard     hrough     he ship; and
wi    h glaring eyes Ahab would burs     from his s    a    e room, as     hough
escaping from a bed     ha     was on fire. Ye         hese, perhaps, ins    ead of
being     he unsuppressable symp    oms of some la    en     weakness, or frigh    
a     his own resolve, were bu         he plaines         okens of i    s
in    ensi    y. For, a     such     imes, crazy Ahab,     he scheming, unappeasedly
s    eadfas     hun    er of     he whi    e whale;     his Ahab     ha     had gone     o his
hammock, was no         he agen         ha     so caused him     o burs     from i     in
horror again. The la        er was     he e    ernal, living principle or soul in
him; and in sleep, being for     he     ime dissocia    ed from     he
charac    erizing mind, which a     o    her     imes employed i     for i    s ou    er

longer an in    egral. Bu     as     he mind does no     exis     unless leagued
wi    h     he soul,     herefore i     mus     have been     ha    , in Ahab's case,
yielding up all his     hough    s and fancies     o his one supreme purpose;
    ha     purpose, by i    s own sheer inve    eracy of will, forced i    self
agains     gods and devils in    o a kind of self-assumed, independen

vi    ali    y     o which i     was conjoined, fled horror-s    ricken from     he
unbidden and unfa    hered bir    h. Therefore,     he     ormen    ed spiri         ha    
glared ou     of bodily eyes, when wha     seemed Ahab rushed from his
room, was for     he     ime bu     a vaca    ed     hing, a formless somnambulis    ic

Since     he above was wri        en,     he s    a    emen     is happily borne ou     by an

The Affidavi    


So far as wha         here may be of a narra    ive in     his book; and, indeed,
as indirec    ly     ouching one or     wo very in    eres    ing and curious
par    iculars in     he habi    s of sperm whales,     he foregoing chap    er, in
i    s earlier par    , is as impor    an     a one as will be found in     his
volume; bu         he leading ma        er of i     requires     o be s    ill fur    her and
more familiarly enlarged upon, in order     o be adequa    ely unders    ood,
and moreover     o     ake away any increduli    y which a profound ignorance
of     he en    ire subjec     may induce in some minds, as     o     he na    ural
veri    y of     he main poin    s of     his affair.

I care no         o perform     his par     of my     ask me    hodically; bu     shall be
con    en         o produce     he desired impression by separa    e ci    a    ions of
i    ems, prac    ically or reliably known     o me as a whaleman; and from
    hese ci    a    ions, I     ake i    -     he conclusion aimed a     will na    urally
follow of i    self.

Firs    : I have personally known     hree ins    ances where a whale, af    er
receiving a harpoon, has effec    ed a comple    e escape; and, af    er an
in    erval (in one ins    ance of     hree years), has been again s    ruck by
    he same hand, and slain; when     he     wo irons, bo    h marked by     he same
priva    e cypher, have been     aken from     he body. In     he ins    ance where
    hree years in    ervened be    ween     he flinging of     he     wo harpoons; and
I     hink i     may have been some    hing more     han     ha    ;     he man who dar    ed
    hem happening, in     he in    erval,     o go in a     rading ship on a voyage
    o Africa, wen     ashore     here, joined a discovery par    y, and
pene    ra    ed far in    o     he in    erior, where he     ravelled for a period of
nearly     wo years, of    en endangered by serpen    s, savages,     igers,
poisonous miasmas, wi    h all     he o    her common perils inciden         o
wandering in     he hear     of unknown regions. Meanwhile,     he whale he
had s    ruck mus     also have been on i    s     ravels; no doub     i     had     hrice
circumnaviga    ed     he globe, brushing wi    h i    s flanks all     he coas    s of
Africa; bu         o no purpose. This man and     his whale again came
    oge    her, and     he one vanquished     he o    her. I say I, myself, have
known     hree ins    ances similar     o     his;     ha     is in     wo of     hem I saw
    he whales s    ruck; and, upon     he second a        ack, saw     he     wo irons
wi    h     he respec    ive marks cu     in     hem, af    erwards     aken from     he dead
fish. In     he     hree-year ins    ance, i     so fell ou         ha     I was in     he
boa     bo    h     imes, firs     and las    , and     he las         ime dis    inc    ly
recognized a peculiar sor     of huge mole under     he whale's eye, which
I had observed     here     hree years previous. I say     hree years, bu     I
am pre        y sure i     was more     han     ha    . Here are     hree ins    ances,     hen,
which I personally know     he     ru    h of; bu     I have heard of many o    her
ins    ances from persons whose veraci    y in     he ma        er     here is no good
ground     o impeach.

Secondly: I     is well known in     he Sperm Whale Fishery, however
ignoran         he world ashore may be of i    ,     ha         here have been several
memorable his    orical ins    ances where a par    icular whale in     he ocean
has been a     dis    an         imes and places popularly cognisable.  Why such
a whale became     hus marked was no     al    oge    her and originally owing     o
his bodily peculiari    ies as dis    inguished from o    her whales; for
however peculiar in     ha     respec     any chance whale may be,     hey soon
pu     an end     o his peculiari    ies by killing him, and boiling him down
in    o a peculiarly valuable oil. No:     he reason was     his:     ha     from
    he fa    al experiences of     he fishery     here hung a     errible pres    ige
of perilousness abou     such a whale as     here did abou     Rinaldo
Rinaldini, insomuch     ha     mos     fishermen were con    en         o recognise him
by merely     ouching     heir     arpaulins when he would be discovered
lounging by     hem on     he sea, wi    hou     seeking     o cul    iva    e a more
in    ima    e acquain    ance. Like some poor devils ashore     ha     happen     o
known an irascible grea     man,     hey make dis    an     unob    rusive
salu    a    ions     o him in     he s    ree    , les     if     hey pursued     he
acquain    ance fur    her,     hey migh     receive a summary     hump for     heir
presump    ion.

Bu     no     only did each of     hese famous whales enjoy grea     individual
celebri    y- nay, you may call i     an oceanwide renown; no     only was he
famous in life and now is immor    al in forecas    le s    ories af    er dea    h,
bu     he was admi        ed in    o all     he righ    s, privileges, and dis    inc    ions
of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar. Was i    
no     so, O Timor Tom!     hou famed levia    han, scarred like a iceberg,
who so long did's     lurk in     he Orien    al s    rai    s of     ha     name, whose
spou     was of     seen from     he palmy beach of Ombay? Was i     no     so, O
New Zealand Jack!     hou     error of all cruisers     ha     crossed     heir
wakes in     he vicini    y of     he Ta        oo Land? Was i     no     so, O Morquan!
King of Japan, whose lof    y je         hey say a         imes assumed     he
semblance of a snow-whi    e cross agains         he sky? Was i     no     so, O Don
Miguel!     hou Chilian whale, marked like an old     or    oise wi    h mys    ic
hieroglyphics upon     he back! In plain prose, here are four whales as
well known     o     he s    uden    s of Ce    acean His    ory as Marius or Sylla     o
    he classic scholar.

Bu         his is no     all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, af    er a     various
    imes crea    ing grea     havoc among     he boa    s of differen     vessels, were
finally gone in ques     of, sys    ema    ically hun    ed ou    , chased and
killed by valian     whaling cap    ains, who heaved up     heir anchors wi    h
    ha     express objec     as much in view, as in se        ing ou         hrough     he
Narraganse         Woods, Cap    ain Bu    ler of old had i     in his mind     o
cap    ure     ha     no    orious murderous savage Annawon,     he headmos     warrior
of     he Indian King Philip.

I do no     know where I can find a be        er place     han jus     here,     o make
men    ion of one or     wo o    her     hings, which     o me seem impor    an    , as in
prin    ed form es    ablishing in all respec    s     he reasonableness of     he
whole s    ory of     he Whi    e Whale, more especially     he ca    as    rophe. For
    his is one of     hose dishear    ening ins    ances where     ru    h requires
full as much bols    ering as error. So ignoran     are mos     landsmen of
some of     he plaines     and mos     palpable wonders of     he world,     ha    
wi    hou     some hin    s     ouching     he plain fac    s, his    orical and
o    herwise, of     he fishery,     hey migh     scou     a     Moby Dick as a
mons    rous fable, or s    ill worse and more de    es    able, a hideous and
in    olerable allegory.

Firs    : Though mos     men have some vague fli        ing ideas of     he general
perils of     he grand fishery, ye         hey have no    hing like a fixed,
vivid concep    ion of     hose perils, and     he frequency wi    h which     hey
recur. One reason perhaps is,     ha     no     one in fif    y of     he ac    ual
disas    ers and dea    hs by casual    ies in     he fishery, ever finds a
public record a     home, however     ransien     and immedia    ely forgo        en
    ha     record. Do you suppose     ha         ha     poor fellow     here, who     his
momen     perhaps caugh     by     he whale-line off     he coas     of New Guinea,
is being carried down     o     he bo        om of     he sea by     he sounding
levia    han- do you suppose     ha         ha     poor fellow's name will appear in
    he newspaper obi    uary you will read     o-morrow a     your breakfas    ? No:
because     he mails are very irregular be    ween here and New Guinea. In
fac    , did you ever hear wha     migh     be called regular news direc     or
indirec     from New Guinea? Ye     I will     ell you     ha     upon one
par    icular voyage which I made     o     he Pacific, among many o    hers we
spoke     hir    y differen     ships, every one of which had had a dea    h by a
whale, some of     hem more     han one, and     hree     ha     had each los     a
boa    's crew.  For God's sake, be economical wi    h your lamps and
candles! no     a gallon you burn, bu     a     leas     one drop of man's blood
was spilled for i    .

Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefini    e idea     ha     a whale
is an enormous crea    ure of enormous power; bu     I have ever found     ha    
when narra    ing     o     hem some specific example of     his     wo-fold
enormousness,     hey have significan    ly complimen    ed me upon my
face    iousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
being face    ious     han Moses, when he wro    e     he his    ory of     he plagues
of Egyp    .

Bu     for    una    ely     he special poin     I here seek can be es    ablished upon
    es    imony en    irely independen     of my own. Tha     poin     is     his: The
Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficien    ly powerful, knowing, and
judiciously malicious, as wi    h direc     afore    hough         o s    ave in,
u        erly des    roy, and sink a large ship; and wha     is more,     he Sperm
Whale has done i    .

Firs    : In     he year 1820     he ship Essex, Cap    ain Pollard, of
Nan    ucke    , was cruising in     he Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spou    s,
lowered her boa    s, and gave chase     o a shoal of sperm whales. Ere
long, several of     he whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very
large whale escaping from     he boa    s, issued from     he shoal, and bore
direc    ly down upon     he ship. Dashing his forehead agains     her hull,
he so s    ove her in,     ha     in less     han "    en minu    es" she se        led down
and fell over. No     a surviving plank of her has been seen
since. Af    er     he severes     exposure, par     of     he
